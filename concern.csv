66ebd000df5d7c0d78c15324,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",14,CARDINAL,CXR,ORG,First,ORDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.1A,ORDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,Identify,WORK_OF_ART,11,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2

66ebd07c66114566e42e3a17,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse.

The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines.

In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown. LIJV, left internal jugular vein; LSV, left subclavian vein; \nRA, right atrium; RIJV, right internal jugular vein; RSV, right subclavian vein. \nRSV\nRIJV\nLIJV\nLSV\nRA\nSVC\nOE\nStomach\nLines, tubes and devices\n135\n11\nits lowest point. This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd15ba5efbfcc5c8e6a2d,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia.

An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged.

This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines.

If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

Is there any other abnormality on the \nCXR?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n156\nQuestion 9\nThis 78-year-old male was admitted to the high dependency unit with an \ninfective exacerbation of COPD and was found to be in type 2 respiratory \nfailure with a respiratory acidosis. Despite noninvasive ventilation (NIV), his \ncondition worsened and he developed increasing breathlessness. What is the \ncause of his deterioration?\nQuestions\n157\n13\nQuestion 10\nThis is the x-ray of a 59-year-old librarian with a history of breast cancer. \nShe was admitted to hospital with a fever.\nWhat abnormality can you see on this x-ray and what is the most likely \ncause?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n158\nANSWERS\nAnswer 1\nThis is definitely not safe to use. The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd18478c2e02274c3aa9c,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd224a28d7ac40552e125,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown. LIJV, left internal jugular vein; LSV, left subclavian vein; \nRA, right atrium; RIJV, right internal jugular vein; RSV, right subclavian vein. \nRSV\nRIJV\nLIJV\nLSV\nRA\nSVC\nOE\nStomach\nLines, tubes and devices\n135\n11\nits lowest point. This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd28c8d2176b3b0c82a69,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

This has a much thicker wall. This \nlesion was found to be due to a cavitating tumour. \nThe thickness of the wall makes this a more likely \ndiagnosis. \nFigure 4.29 \nLEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (LVF)\nIf you suspect heart failure as a cause of a generalised, or localised, area of \nshadowing (Fig. 4.30A,B) then:\n1.	 Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd2d58c84c9354e227026,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown. LIJV, left internal jugular vein; LSV, left subclavian vein; \nRA, right atrium; RIJV, right internal jugular vein; RSV, right subclavian vein. \nRSV\nRIJV\nLIJV\nLSV\nRA\nSVC\nOE\nStomach\nLines, tubes and devices\n135\n11\nits lowest point. This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd3019e14a72003405cc7,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown. LIJV, left internal jugular vein; LSV, left subclavian vein; \nRA, right atrium; RIJV, right internal jugular vein; RSV, right subclavian vein. \nRSV\nRIJV\nLIJV\nLSV\nRA\nSVC\nOE\nStomach\nLines, tubes and devices\n135\n11\nits lowest point. This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd36be9ff2e70984466df,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia.

This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

What is the cause of his pleuritic \nchest pain?\nQuestions\n151\n13\nQuestion 4\nThis 22-year-old male was admitted as an emergency, very short of breath \nand requiring 35% oxygen. This was the x-ray taken in the emergency depart­\nment. Describe what you see on the chest x-ray. Why is the patient short of \nbreath?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n152\nQuestion 5\nThis is the x-ray of a 45-year-old teacher who presented to her GP following \nfour episodes of haemoptysis. Are there any abnormalities on the CXR?\nQuestions\n153\n13\nQuestion 6\nThis is the CXR of a 60-year-old bus driver who presented with cough produc­\ntive of green sputum and fever.\nWhat abnormalities can you see on this x-ray?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n154\nQuestion 7\nThis is the CXR of a 71-year-old retired teacher who presented to his doctor \nwith a 6-month history of gradually increasing shortness of breath.\nWhat abnormalities do you see and why is the patient breathless?\nQuestions\n155\n13\nQuestion 8\nThis is the CXR of a 68-year-old retired postman. He presented with abdomi­\nnal pain and was found to be in acute renal failure. He failed to make recovery \nwith aggressive intravenous fluid and was transferred to the intensive care unit \n(ICU). On arrival on the ICU, a central line was inserted.\nComment of the position of the line. Is there any other abnormality on the \nCXR?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n156\nQuestion 9\nThis 78-year-old male was admitted to the high dependency unit with an \ninfective exacerbation of COPD and was found to be in type 2 respiratory \nfailure with a respiratory acidosis. Despite noninvasive ventilation (NIV), his \ncondition worsened and he developed increasing breathlessness. What is the \ncause of his deterioration?\nQuestions\n157\n13\nQuestion 10\nThis is the x-ray of a 59-year-old librarian with a history of breast cancer. \nShe was admitted to hospital with a fever.\nWhat abnormality can you see on this x-ray and what is the most likely \ncause?\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n158\nANSWERS\nAnswer 1\nThis is definitely not safe to use. The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

66ebd3da2a4f57c4c92fc3fa,"Localising lesions\n14\nTHE LUNGS\nAs well as knowing what a lesion is, it is often important to know its position \nwithin the lung. To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

The fluid now encases the lung and the \nincreased whiteness can be seen around the apex \nof the lung. Compare this almost totally white lung \nwith the appearance following a pneumonectomy. \nIn the case of a large pleural effusion, the \nmediastinum may be pushed away from the \nmidline by the large volume of fluid. \nFigure 4.19\nlikely to be a transudate. Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis. You can see a fairly thick-walled cavity (arrow) in the right apex.\nFigure 4.42  CXR showing an area of upper lobe consolidation (1) in patient with \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\nMiliary shadowing\n91\n4\nFigure 4.44  Multiple cavities in tuberculosis (arrows). \nFigure 4.45  Tuberculosis in hilar nodes.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown.

This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the

To accurately localise a lesion on a chest x-ray (CXR) you \nneed to look at both the posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral films. First look \nat the PA film (Fig. 2.1A, B):\n1\nA\nFigure 2.1  The x-ray shows a right upper \nzone mass lesion. (A) The PA film shows that it lies \nabove the horizontal fissure (1). \nLocalising lesions\n16\n2.	 Look at the borders of the lesion. If the lesion is next to a dense (white) \nstructure then the border between the lesion and that structure will be \nlost – this is called the silhouette sign. Therefore if the lesion is in the \nright lung and obscures part of the heart border it must be in the right \nmiddle lobe. If it obscures the border of the diaphragm it is in the right \nlower lobe.\nIf the lesion is not going to be localised by computed tomography (CT), \nthen a lateral film will be needed.\nUsing the lateral film, if the lesion is in the right lung:\n1.	 Identify the oblique fissure (see p. 11). If the lesion lies posterior to the \noblique fissure it must lay within the lower lobe no matter how high it \nappears on the PA film.\n1\nA\n5\n6\n2\nV\n3\n4\nA\nFigure 2.2  (A) This x-ray is of a patient with an \natrial (A) and ventricular (V) pacing wire, with the \npacemaker box over the left anterior chest (1–6). \n(1) Right atrium; (2) Superior vena cava; (3) Left \nventricle; (4) Left atrial appendage; (5) Pulmonary \nartery; (6), Aortic knuckle. \nLocalising lesions\n18\nA\nA\nM\nFigure 2.3  Radiographs of a patient with prosthetic \naortic (A) and mitral (M) valves showing their position \nin the (A) AP and (B) lateral films. \nTHE HEART\nIn order to fully assess any abnormalities of the shape of the heart it is impor­\ntant to understand the composition of the heart shadow. Look at Figure 2.2A, \nB and Figure 2.3A, B.\n1.	 Look at the right heart border and follow it up from the diaphragm. \nFrom the diaphragm to the hilum the heart border is formed by the \nedge of the right atrium (1). From the hilum upwards it is formed by \nthe superior vena cava (2).\nLocalising lesions\n20\nThe lateral film is useful. The posterior border of the heart shadow is made \nup of the left ventricle (7) and the anterior border the right ventricle (8). For \nexample (see Fig. 2.3A and B), to identify whether a valve replacement is mitral \nor aortic, draw an imaginary line from the apex of the heart to the hilum. If \nthe replacement valve lies above this line it is aortic and if it lies below or on, \nit is mitral.\nThe CT scan\n22\nAlthough the plain chest x-ray (CXR) is one of the most useful imaging tech­\nniques, it is limited by the fact that it is a two-dimensional image and small \nor subtle abnormalities can be overlooked. In other circumstances the CXR \nwill identify an abnormality but will give limited information as to its extent \nor detailed appearance. Remember also that, although particularly useful for \ndetecting lung abnormalities, the CXR is a very poor way of imaging the \nmediastinum.\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning\nA computed tomography (CT) scanner takes multiple cross-sectional images \nof the body. A completed CT scan of the chest usually consists of two complete \nsets of images, one showing mediastinal structures (in which the lung fields \nlook relatively black) and one showing the lung fields in which the mediasti­\nnum looks relatively white. These are called the mediastinal and lung windows. \nThese two sets are necessary because there are not enough shades of grey to \ndisplay adequately both the high-density mediastinal structures and the low-\ndensity lungs using one linear scale. In the lung windows the grey scale \nis expanded across the range of lower-density structures, whereas in the \nmediastinal windows the scale is expanded over the higher-density structures.\nTypes of CT scan\nTwo main types of CT scans are performed for the chest: contiguous (spiral) \nand high resolution. You will need to understand the difference between these \nin order to know what to request and also to appreciate their limitations. If \nyou include all the relevant history on the scan request, and clearly state the \nquestion that needs answering, the radiologist is much more likely to under­\ntake the most appropriate scan.\nHigh-resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\nThis is a sampling test, which means that not all the lung is examined. With \nthis technique 1–2 mm slices are taken about 10 mm apart. This technique is \nvery good for detecting interstitial lung disease since the thin slices allow for \na very detailed assessment of lung architecture (rather like a thin tissue slice \nenables a pathologist to see more detail). It is not a good technique for finding \nmass lesions (for example, lung tumours) because the lesion could occur in \none of the spaces between the slices and so be missed. The high-resolution CT \n(HRCT) scan is usually acquired over several breath holds.\nIntravenous contrast would not be used with HRCT, since contrast would \nneed to be given before each individual image was taken – something that is \nclearly impossible.\nContiguous (spiral) CT\nThis is also called helical CT or volumetric CT. In this technique the anode \nof the scanner rotates continuously whilst the table on which the patient lies \nis moved at a predetermined speed. This technique has the advantage that it \nThe CT scan\n23\n3\nis extremely quick – 7 to 10 seconds. The whole chest is scanned, so that small \nlesions are not likely to be missed, unlike in HRCT where there is a gap \nbetween the slices. Sometimes patients are so breathless that they breathe \nduring the scan, causing blurring of the images and making interpretation \nmore difficult.\nSpiral CTs are used when intravenous contrast needs to be administered, \nfor example when staging a lung cancer or detecting a pulmonary embolus. \nThe exact timing of the administration of contrast depends on the abnormality \nbeing sought. For example, contrast will be injected at a different time for the \ndetection of a pulmonary embolus than it would be if it was being used to \nenhance the structures of the mediastinum. This is why it is important to give \nfull clinical details when ordering a CT scan and to be specific about the ques­\ntion being asked. A scan performed to detect a pulmonary embolus will use \na different protocol for administration of contrast than a scan performed for \nthe full staging of a lung cancer. The scan can only be interpreted fully if the \nappropriate protocol has been used.\nCombined imaging\nMany CT scanners are able to acquire spiral images, and with the same data \nset can process the image to produce a high-resolution study. If a patient only \nneeds a HRCT, this should be requested, as combined imaging exposes the \npatient to a higher radiation dose.\nInterpreting the images\nInterpretation of the CT scan requires significant expertise and should only \nbe done by a radiologist. As well as having the experience to interpret the \nimage slices, radiologists have access to software that will allow them to \ndisplay the images in other forms, for example in the sagittal and coronal \nplanes as well as cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The CT scans \nwe have included in this book have been chosen because they illustrate situa­\ntions in which, working on the wards, emergency department or outpatients, \nyou are likely to order scans and a basic knowledge of how they are interpreted \nwill be of use.\nFinding your way around the CT scan\nIt is complicated, but if you learn a few basic areas of anatomy, the rest can \nbe built on later. As with a plain CXR it is important that you have a scheme \nto work with. The way to make the anatomy as simple as possible is to learn \nthe basic structures at key slices of the CT scan. Once you have identified the \nslice and the structures, you can follow these up and down the chest by looking \nat consecutive slices.\nThe mediastinal windows\nYou first need to look at the mediastinal windows. Figure 3.1A–F illustrates \nthe key slices you should identify. If you learn the anatomy at each of these \nlevels you should be able to find your way around the CT scan.\nThe CT scan\n33\n3\non the table, which causes a blurring of the image. There will also be cardiac \nmotion, which can blur the appearance of the lung closest to the heart.\nWhen contrast is being injected there is very dense fluid flowing through \nthe veins into the right heart. This density, especially when it is in the superior \nvena cava, causes white streakiness in the adjacent structures. This is called a \nstreak artefact and can sometimes obscure important information. To counter \nthis, the radiologist will sometimes wash the contrast out with a second injec­\ntion of saline. Metalwork such as spinal fixators will also cause significant \nstreak artefact.\nFOCUS ON RADIATION\nEveryone is exposed to radiation. One of the major contributors to environmental \nexposure is radon gas which is emitted from a number of rocks such as shale and \ngranite. Exposure to radiation is measured in millisieverts (mSv) and the average \nexposure to environmental radiation is 2.4 mSv each year.\nRadiation can cause cancer and birth abnormalities and it is important to limit \na patient’s exposure to radiation by avoiding unnecessary procedures. For every \n1000 patients exposed to 10 mSv of radiation one will develop cancer as a result: \nfor example, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) results in exposure to 15.0 mSv \n(Table 3.1). Although exposure resulting from a standard x-ray is small you must \nremember that there will be cumulative effects in patients that have multiple \nCXRs. In pregnancy the danger from chest imaging is to the mother rather than \nthe fetus. The fetus lies outside the field of radiation but in pregnancy the mother’s \nbreast tissue will be far more sensitive than usual and the risk of causing breast \ncancer is assumed to be higher.\nUnnecessary x-rays can be avoided by giving the radiologist full clinical details \nwhen the request is made or by discussing the request directly with the radiolo­\ngist who may suggest alternative methods of imaging. In pregnancy there are \ntwo dangers. The first is exposing a pregnant patient to unnecessary radiation but \nthe second is not carrying out necessary tests and missing important diagnoses. \nDiscussion with a radiologist is the best way of avoiding both these dangers.\nTable 3.1  Exposure to radiation from different procedures\nProcedure\nRadiation exposure (mSv)\nChest x-ray\n0.02\nVentilation perfusion scan\n2.0\nCT chest*\n7.0\nCT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)\n15.0\n*Recent low dose CT techniques deliver doses of 0.8-1.0 mSv and are being used for lung \ncancer screening.\nThe white lung field\n36\nCOLLAPSE\nCollapse of a lung is an important cause of a white lung seen on x-rays \n(Figs 4.1–4.5). When confronted with a white lung it is important to be thor­\nough in looking for the features suggestive of collapse since the presence of \ncollapse indicates possible serious pathology.\nCollapse of the lung leads to a loss of volume of that part of the lung and \nso the normal radiological landmarks will be distorted. To diagnose collapse \nlook at each of these markings carefully and decide whether they are in the \n2\n1\nA\nFigure 4.1  Right upper lobe collapse. (A) There \nis an area of whiteness in the upper zone of the \nright lung (1). The horizontal fissure is elevated, \nthere is an apparent right upper hilar ‘mass’, \nthe trachea is deviated to the right (2) and the \nribs over the area of whiteness are closer \ntogether than is normal. \nThe white lung field\n38\n2\n3\n1\nA\nFigure 4.2  Right middle lobe collapse. (A) This can \nbe difficult to spot. The right diaphragm may be \nslightly raised (1) and the horizontal fissure (2) may \nbe lower than usual. The upper part of the lower \nzone may have a hazy white appearance (3) and \nthe heart border is sometimes indistinct. \n4.	 Look for the horizontal fissure in the right lung (Fig. 1.1). The horizontal \nfissure on the right should run from the centre of the right hilum to the \nlevel of the 6th rib at the axillary line. If this is pulled up, it suggests right \nupper lobe collapse or, if pulled down, right lower lobe collapse.\n5.	 The heart should straddle the midline with one-third to the right and \ntwo-thirds to the left. The heart shadow will be deviated to the side of \ncollapse.\n6.	 The heart borders should be distinct. If the lung adjacent to the heart is \ncollapsed then the heart border will appear blurred. If the right heart \nborder is blurred this indicates right middle lobe collapse and if the left \nis blurred, lingular collapse.\n7.	 The trachea should be central. Collapse of the right or left upper lobes \ncan pull the trachea towards the area of collapse. Again this may be \neasier to spot by comparing with the patient’s old films.\nThe white lung field\n40\n1\nA\nFigure 4.3  Right lower lobe collapse. (A) There is a \nwhiteness immediately above the diaphragm \n(1), causing a loss of its outline. \nThe white lung field\n42\nFigure 4.4  Left upper lobe collapse. (A) This is \ndifficult to spot. Remember that most of the left \nupper lobe lies in front of, as opposed to above, the \nleft lower lobe. When it collapses it causes a haze to \nappear over the whole of the left lung field. (B) The \nCT image shows the midpoint of the mediastinum \nshifted to the left (1). The left upper lobe bronchus \nis filled by a soft tissue density: a tumour (2). The \ndiagnosis can be easily achieved at bronchoscopy. \nA\n2\n1\nB\nCollapse\n43\n4\nA\n1\n1\nFigure 4.5  Left lower lobe collapse. \n(A) This is easy to miss. The left \nlower lobe collapses down behind \nthe heart. The left lung field appears \nmuch darker than normal and the \nheart shadow will appear much \nwhiter than normal. If you look \ncarefully you can see a white triangle \nbehind the heart (1). This is \nsometimes called the sail sign.\nThe white lung field\n44\nB\n2\n2\n(B) On the lateral \nfilm you may see a white \ntriangle at the bottom \nposterior corner of the lung \nfields (2) and the vertebral \nbodies will appear whiter. \nFigure 4.5 \nCollapse\n47\n4\n1.	 Look at the mediastinal windows. If a contrast CT has been performed you \nshould still see white blood vessels coursing through the area of collapse. \nThis is because the lung collapses around the blood vessels within it.\n2.	 There would be no air bronchograms since the bronchus proximally \nwould be occluded, stopping air from entering the collapsed \nlung.\n3.	 Find a large airway that enters the abnormal area. The airway should \ncome to an abrupt end at the area of collapse. Sometimes you can see \nan area of irregularity within the airway which signifies an obstructing \nlesion.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the abnormal area. A collapsed lung is often wedge \nshaped, with the point towards the central hilum.\n5.	 Look for signs of volume loss caused by the collapse; these can be \nvariable in their appearances. Look for mediastinal shift of the \nfissures.\nA collapsed lung can be caused by the presence of a tumour and it is \nimportant to be able to identify this. A tumour may give the area of collapse \na more lobular, less smooth appearance. A tumour may also cause the adjacent \nfissure to bulge outwards, something that would not happen with other causes \nof collapse.\nFigure 4.10  Left lower lobe collapse. Image shows the appearance of left lower lobe \ncollapse on the lung windows of a CT scan. There is a dense opacity (1) in the left lung \npostero-medially with smooth curved edges and no air bronchograms. Contrast is visible \nin the aorta and pulmonary arteries. \n1\nThe white lung field\n48\nVOLUME LOSS\nA pneumonectomy is another cause of a white lung (Figs 4.11–4.12). You \nshould know from the history and your examination that the patient has had \na pneumonectomy. Look at the x-ray for the following features:\n1.	 Look at the mediastinum. Look first at the trachea (Figs 4.11–4.13), \nwhich should be shifted to the side of the pneumonectomy, then look at \nthe heart border. With a pneumonectomy the heart is often shifted so far \nthat its border is no longer visible.\nFigure 4.11  Patient had a pneumonectomy several \nyears ago. The left hemithorax is white, and the \nmediastinum has shifted to the left. The left-sided \nribs are also crowded together compared to the \nright side, and the patient has developed a slight \ncurvature of the spine. The right lung becomes \nhyperinflated, and some of the lung crosses over \nthe midline. \nVolume loss\n49\n4\nFigure 4.12  Patient had right upper lobectomy and \npostoperative radiotherapy. Both of these have led to \nvolume loss in the remaining right lung. The trachea has \nbeen pulled to the right as a result. The lung is of \nincreased blackness on the right compared to the left \nbecause the remaining lung is hyperinflated. The right \ndiaphragm has also changed shape, and this appearance \nis known as diaphragmatic tenting. It looks as though a \ntent pole has been put underneath to push it upwards. \n2.	 Look at the opposite lung field. Since the mediastinum is shifted the \ncontralateral lung is hyperinflated and so appears darker than usual.\n3.	 Look at the side of the whiteness. You should not be able to see the \nupper border of the diaphragm on the side of the pneumonectomy.\n4.	 Look carefully at the ribs. If the patient has had a pneumonectomy, ribs \nwould either have been cut or removed during the operation. Therefore \nlook for any rib deformity or note the absence of any rib which would \nhelp confirm the diagnosis. The most usual rib to be affected is the 5th rib.\nA very rare cause of a similar appearance is extensive hypoplasia or \ncongenital absence of one lung.\nThe white lung field\n50\nFigure 4.13  Tracheal deviation can be the \nresult of it being pushed by a mass lesion in the \nmediastinum, most often an enlarged thyroid \ngland, as in the case shown here. The lung \nvolumes in this case are normal, and the ribs and \ndiaphragms are in their normal positions. In the \nelderly a very tortuous aorta may also lead to \ntracheal shift. \nConsolidation\n51\n4\nCONSOLIDATION\nAn area of white lung is shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15. Look first at the \nnature of the whiteness and its border. If it is uniform with a well-demarcated \nborder, you are much more likely to be dealing with an area of collapse or a \npleural effusion. If the shadowing is not uniform and the border is not so well \ndemarcated, the possibilities are consolidation, fibrosis or some other infiltra­\ntive condition. It can be difficult to diagnose consolidation, so make your way \ncarefully through the following steps:\n1.	 Remember the clinical history. In the presence of a temperature \nand signs of infection, consolidation is by far the most likely \nabnormality.\n2.	 Look at old x-rays. Fibrosis is usually a chronic condition and \nconsolidation much more transient. The presence of a similar \nabnormality on a previous x-ray should lead you to suspect fibrosis \nrather than consolidation.\n3.	 Look carefully at the nature of the shadowing. In consolidation the \nalveolar spaces become filled with fluid, making them appear white, \nwhereas the airways retain air, making them appear black. If you look \nclosely at an area of consolidation you can often make out the small \nairways as black against a white background – the so-called ‘air \nbronchogram’ (Fig. 4.14).\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Fluid sinks, so consolidation \ngets denser as one moves down the lung. The shadowing in consolidation \nwill often be denser and more clearly demarcated at its lower border \n(Fig. 4.15).\nConsolidation and CT\nFigure 4.16 shows the appearance of consolidation on a CT scan. You \nwill see that it has the same characteristics as consolidation on the \nplain film. The key feature is the presence of the air bronchogram, the \nairways appearing black against the white background of the consolidated \nalveolar. This is usually much more obvious on a CT than a plain \nfilm.\nPneumonia is not the only cause of consolidation. Other, rarer causes are \nshown in Box 4.1.\nThe white lung field\n52\nBox 4.1  Other causes of consolidation\nBronchoalveolar cell carcinoma\nCryptogenic organising pneumonia\nEosinophilic pneumonia\nCardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nNoncardiogenic pulmonary oedema\nPulmonary haemorrhage\nAlveolar proteinosis\nFigure 4.14  This is the appearance of a lobar \npneumonia. Notice how the inferior margin of the \nconsolidation is quite straight. This appearance \nindicates a right upper lobe pneumonia. An air \nbronchogram (arrow) is visible. \nConsolidation\n53\n4\nFigure 4.15  A much more widespread \nconsolidation affecting both lungs is shown, \nespecially in the mid to lower zones, and is a \nbronchopneumonia. An air bronchogram (arrow) \nis visible. \nFigure 4.16  CT lung window settings. This is the CT of 69-year-old man with history of \nCOPD, who was admitted severely unwell with history of increased breathlessness, cough \nand fever. The CT shows an area of dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The black \nairways (1) against the white background of fluid-filled airspaces indicate consolidation. \n1\nThe white lung field\n54\nFOCUS ON PNEUMONIA\nA chest x-ray is needed to confidently diagnose pneumonia and careful \nexamination of the x-ray can give clues to its aetiology. It is important to repeat \nthe x-ray if the patient does not respond to treatment as expected. Otherwise, if \nthe patient makes an uneventful recovery a follow up x-ray is only needed in \npatients with persistent symptoms or signs or who are at a higher risk of \nmalignancy.\nAETIOLOGY\nAlthough it is not possible to diagnose the aetiology of pneumonia from a \nchest x-ray, it will give you some helpful clues. Look for multilobular involve­\nment, which is more common with pneumococcal pneumonia and the \ninfluenza virus. The presence of multiple cavities suggests Staphylococcus \naureus infection. Upper lobe infection is more common in Klebsiella pneumoniae \nand tuberculosis (TB). Pneumonia caused by the influenza virus is commonly \nbilateral and patchy in nature and may cause multifocal ground glass \nshadowing.\nPERSISTENT PNEUMONIA\nIf there is no clinical improvement after 48 hours of treatment a follow-up \nCXR should be ordered. Look carefully at the lung fields for evidence of a pulmo­\nnary abscess, which will appear as a thin-walled cavity. This is more common in \ndebilitated patients such as those who are malnourished and means that a much \nlonger course of antibiotics (typically 6 weeks) will be needed. Look carefully at \nthe lung volumes. There may be collapse of areas of the lung secondary to \nobstruction that will make the pneumonia harder to clear. Look again at the lung \nparenchyma for evidence of underlying bronchiectasis that may be subtle and \neasily missed.\nLook for the presence of pleural fluid (Fig. 4.2). This may suggest that the \npatient has developed either a reactive pleural effusion or an empyema. It is \nimpossible on a CXR to distinguish between a reactive pleural effusion and an \nempyema so any fluid should be sampled, preferably under ultrasound guidance. \nThick turbid fluid with a low pH and low glucose indicates the presence of an \nempyema, which should be drained.\nLook at the extent of the consolidation. You would not expect to see signifi­\ncant improvement in the CXR appearance within 48 hours of treatment. However, \na worsening of the x-ray shadowing may suggest that the patient is on the wrong \nantibiotics or may lead you to consider an alternative diagnosis, such as acute \nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nIf your patient does not improve and there is no obvious clinical, microbiologi­\ncal or radiological reason, consider ordering a CT scan. This will allow you to look \nfor obstruction of a bronchus; it may reveal a pulmonary abscess not visible on \nthe plain CXR.\n55\n4\nPneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP)\nFinally think about the possibility of an alternative diagnosis. Discuss the \nrequest with a radiologist who will be able to examine the nature and distribution \nof the shadowing and advice on whether an alternative diagnosis, for example \nan eosinophilic pneumonia, is likely.\nUNDERLYING PATHOLOGY\nAll patients should be reviewed after 6 weeks and if they have persistent symp­\ntoms or signs, or are at risk of malignancy (smokers and those over 50 years of \nage), a follow-up x-ray should be arranged.\nThe purpose of the follow-up CXR is to check for complete resolution of the \nCXR changes. If the 6-week CXR continues to show consolidation you will needto \ninvestigate further since one of the commoner causes of persistent consolidation \nis bronchial obstruction, for example by a lung cancer. The patient’s x-rays should \nbe discussed with a radiologist. A CT scan or bronchoscopy may be needed to \nexclude an underlying lesion.\nPNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (JIROVECI) PNEUMONIA (PCP)\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) can be difficult to diagnose on \na CXR and in 10% of patients with PCP the CXR is normal (Fig. 4.17). \nIf a patient presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia that are out \nof proportion to a relatively normal-looking CXR then PCP should be \nsuspected.\nIf you suspect that the CXR shadowing may be due to PCP then look for \nthe following features:\n1.	 Look at lung volumes. Very early PCP may be suspected when \nboth lungs show reduced volume. Look for an old CXR. If there is one, \ncompare the lung volumes to those on a CXR taken when the patient \nwas well.\n2.	 Look at the area around the hilum. In PCP there is often white \nshadowing in this region. This can be very vague. You can best \nappreciate it by looking at the blood vessels as they come away from \nthe hila. In PCP the blood vessels will appear less well defined than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look for peribronchial cuffing. This is best seen in airways that are \nseen ‘end-on’ and is due to fluid seen as increased whiteness within \nthe walls of the airways. This gives the wall of the airway a thickened \nor fuzzy appearance, with a central hole, rather like a well-sucked \n‘Polo’ mint.\n4.	 Look for large areas of whiteness extending throughout the lung fields. \nThese may develop as the disease progresses and represent large areas of \nconsolidation. Typically, in PCP the whiteness does not extend to the \napices or affect the costophrenic angles.\nThe white lung field\n56\nFigure 4.17  This patient is on long-term \nimmunosuppression following renal transplant. He \npresented with a week-long history of a dry cough and \nincreasing breathlessness. Following bronchoscopy and \nlavage he was diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia, \nan organism recognised to cause pneumonia in immune \ncompromise from many causes. The film shows vague \nwhite shadowing around the hilum. There is also \nenlargement of the right hilum from lymphadenopathy. \nPCP and CT\nA CT scan is much more sensitive than a CXR in the diagnosis of PCP and a \nnormal CT virtually excludes the diagnosis. There are two things to look for \non the CT scan (Fig. 4.18).\n1.	 The presence of ground glass shadowing. As described on page 84, \nthis is shadowing that does not obscure the underlying structures of \nthe lung so blood vessels and airways can be seen through it. Look \nat the distribution of the ground glass shadowing. As with the CXR \nthese are found around the hilar areas and are bilateral and often \nasymmetrical.\n2.	 You may sometimes see small cysts and areas of consolidation.\n57\n4\nPleural effusion\nFigure 4.18  CT lung window settings. Male patient presented with a three-day history of \nincreasing shortness of breath and was severely hypoxic on admission. The CT scan is \nvery suggestive of PCP and shows bilateral ground glass shadowing (1). There are also \nsome areas of consolidation (2). Although no obvious risk factors, blood tests taken on \nadmission showed him to be HIV positive and PCP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar \nlavage. \n1\n1\n2\n1\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\nIf you see an area of whiteness at the base of a lung then the possible causes \nare a pleural effusion (Fig. 4.19A,B), a raised hemidiaphragm and an area of \nconsolidation or collapse. You need to determine which of these it is.\n1.	 Look closely at the texture of the whiteness. Consolidation usually causes \nmore heterogeneous shadowing, typically with the presence of an air \nbronchogram. Look carefully for an air bronchogram (Fig. 4.15) since its \npresence will point to consolidation rather than a pleural effusion.\n2.	 Look at the shape of the upper border of the shadowing. Fluid will often \nhave a meniscus, so the upper outer border of an effusion will be concave.\n3.	 To differentiate an effusion from a raised hemidiaphragm look again at \nthe shape of the upper border. The upper border of an effusion will peak \nmuch more laterally than you would expect the diaphragm to do. This is \na matter of looking at lots of x-rays.\n4.	 Look for mediastinal shift. It can be difficult to differentiate an effusion \nfrom lung collapse. Collapse usually causes mediastinal shift towards the \nwhite lung field, so the absence of shift suggests the presence of an \neffusion. Remember, however, that collapse can accompany an effusion \nso that, although the absence of shift implies an effusion, its presence \ndoes not exclude it.\n5.	 A lateral view is often helpful since the meniscus on a lateral can be \nmuch more obvious. Look for the presence of a meniscus, which, often \non the lateral, is seen to extend up into one of the fissures.\n6.	 If you diagnose an effusion on CXR look for possible causes (see Box \n4.2). Is the effusion bilateral or unilateral? If it is bilateral it is more \nThe white lung field\n58\nA\nFigure 4.19  The varied appearances of pleural \neffusions are shown.

Check the size of the heart (a large heart points \nto heart failure) and look at the hilum for possible enlargement. Look at \nthe visible parts of the lung fields for obvious masses and check the \nbones for signs of metastasis. Look very carefully at the apices of the \nlungs for tumours and TB.\n7.	 To confirm the presence of pleural fluid request an ultrasound of the \nchest. This is particularly important if you plan to aspirate the effusion \nor put in a chest drain.\nThe white lung field\n60\nASBESTOS PLAQUES\nPleural plaques represent areas of pleural thickening caused by exposure to \nasbestos fibres (Fig. 4.20). They may be predominantly soft tissue with small \namounts of calcium or be heavily calcified. Isolated pleural thickening is a \ncause of a localised area of white lung and can be difficult to separate from \nlung shadows. If you suspect pleural plaques then:\n1.	 Look throughout the lung fields of both lungs. Pleural thickening is easy \nto identify at the periphery where it appears as a thickened line around \nthe edge of the lung. If you can identify pleural thickening here it makes \nit more likely that the other areas of whiteness are plaques superimposed \nover the lung field.\n2.	 Carefully look at the position of the whiteness and compare it to what \nyou know of the anatomy of the lung. If the whiteness follows \nintrapulmonary structures, for example a lobe of the lung, then it may be \noriginating from the lung itself. If it crosses such structures then it is \nprobably pleural.\n3.	 Compare the distribution of the whiteness to the line of the anterior \nportion of the ribs. Asbestos plaques are very commonly found running \nalong the line of the anterior portion of the ribs.\n4.	 Look at the distribution of the patches. Pleural plaques are most prevalent \nin the mid zones and axillary region of the mid chest. They tend to spare \nthe upper zones and costophrenic angles. Look carefully at both lung \nfields. Pleural plaques are usually bilateral and you should be wary \nof making this diagnosis if they are present in only one pleural cavity.\n5.	 Look at the diaphragm. Pleural plaques along the diaphragm are often \ncalcified. If you see streaks of dense white material (calcium) running \nalong the diaphragm it implies that pleural plaques are present.\n6.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. Pleural plaques are patchy in nature \nas opposed to a pleural effusion, which is more uniform. Plaques are \nsometimes said to have a map-like appearance due to areas of patchy \ncalcification within them. Look at their edge. This should be well defined \nas opposed to ‘companion shadows’ that have poorly defined margins.\n7.	 Look at the patient’s old x-rays. Pleural plaques are slow growing and \nare probably visible on previous x-rays.\nAsbestos plaques\n61\n4\nFigure 4.20  A CXR of a 63-year-old man admitted \nfollowing a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (hence \nthe central venous pressure line) who had been \nexposed to asbestos whilst working in a naval \ndockyard. You can see multiple calcified pleural \nplaques on the inner chest wall. \nThe white lung field\n62\nMESOTHELIOMA\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumour of the pleura (Fig. 4.21; Box 4.3). The \nshadowing it causes will have the characteristics of pleural shadowing and \nsome of the characteristics of malignant shadows. If you suspect the whiteness \nto be mesothelioma then:\n1.	 Look carefully at the spread of the whiteness and determine whether it \nfollows lung boundaries. If it does not, then the whiteness may be \npleural in origin.\n2.	 Look at the margins of the whiteness. If they are lobulated in nature, \nthen this suggests malignancy (Fig. 4.21).\nFigure 4.21  A CXR of a 68-year-old man with a \nhistory of asbestos exposure. He presented with \nright lateral chest wall pains. The CXR demonstrates \nlobulated pleural thickening around the upper, mid \nand basal right lung, with further pleural thickening \nevident next to the right side of the mediastinum. \nCT of a mesothelioma in a different patient is \nshown in Figure 4.22. \n63\n4\nPleural disease on a CT scan\nBox 4.3  Pleural tumours\nMesothelioma\nPrimary pleural adenocarcinoma\nPleural sarcoma\nPleural fibromas\nNeurofibromas arising paravertebrally or in relation to an intercostal nerve\nSecondaries\n3.	 Look at the upper edge of the whiteness. The main differential is a \npleural effusion. A pleural effusion would be unlikely if the upper edge \nwas lobulated and no meniscus was visible.\n4.	 Compare the volume of the affected side. Loss of volume on the affected \nside may increase your suspicions of a mesothelioma.\n5.	 A radiological diagnosis of mesothelioma usually requires a CT \nscan.\nPLEURAL DISEASE ON A CT SCAN\nThe pleura should not really be visible on a CT scan, since they are so thin. \nIf you see an increased grey area on the inner surface of the chest wall, then \nsuspect that the patient may have pleural disease. Pleural abnormalities are \nbest seen on a spiral CT (Figs 4.22–4.25).\nRemember, the pleura is in two layers with a potential space in between. \nPleural thickening can affect the visceral (next to the lung) or the parietal (next \nto the chest wall) pleura. The double layers of pleura run into and out of the \nfissures of the lung.\nIf you see increased density around the inner chest wall:\n1.	 Look at the colour of the pleural density on the soft tissue window.\na.  Is it grey? The commonest pleural abnormality is pleural fluid. This \nwill appear darker than the muscles of the chest wall. If the pleural \ndensity is the same as the chest wall, it is more likely to be pleural \nthickening.\nb.	 Is it white? This is more likely to be pleural calcification. Pleural \nplaques often contain very bright white areas where they have \ncalcified.\n2.	 Are the margins of the pleural density smooth or lobulated?\na.	 Does it have smooth margins? This may be pleural fluid or pleural \nthickening. Multiple discrete lesions that are short but quite deep are \nprobably pleural plaques.\nb.	 Does it have lobulated margins? This is more likely to be a \nmalignancy.\nThe white lung field\n66\nLUNG NODULE\nThe term ‘lung nodule’ is used to describe a discrete area of whiteness situated \nwithin a lung field (Figs 4.26 and 4.27; Box 4.4). It is less than 3 cm in diam­\neter. A ‘coin lesion’ refers to any well-defined nodular type lesion, which is \nusually, though not necessarily, round. The main worry is that these may \nrepresent a carcinoma. Other possibilities are a localised area of consolidation, \nan abscess or a pleural abnormality. Go through the following steps in assess­\ning the abnormality:\n1.	 Look at the edge of the lesion. A spiculated, irregular or lobulated edge \nis suggestive of malignancy.\n2.	 Look for areas of calcification. These would be dense white (the same \ndensity as bone) and be obviously much denser than the rest of the \nlesion. Calcification is rare in a malignant lesion and would point you to \nan alternative diagnosis.\n3.	 Look at the nature of the whiteness. If the lesion is cavitating the centre \nmay be darker than the circumference. If looking at an x-ray film, stand \nback from the x-ray since a cavity is often easier to see from a distance.\nFigure 4.26  There is a 3 cm round nodule in the \nleft mid zone. This would need to be investigated \nas it may represent a small tumour. The nodule \ncould be biopsied percutaneously under CT \nguidance. \nCavitating lung lesion\n69\n4\nA\nFigure 4.29  Cavitating lung lesions.

Look at the size of the heart. The presence of left ventricular dilatation is \nstrongly suggestive of heart failure. In a PA film the maximum diameter \nof the heart should be less than half that of the maximum diameter of \nthe thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio). If it exceeds this, then there is a \ncardiac abnormality, such as left ventricular enlargement, and this \nsuggests that the associated shadowing is due to left ventricular failure \n(LVF) (see Chapter 7 for other causes of an enlarged cardiac shadow). \nYou cannot comment on the size of the heart on an anterior-posterior \n(AP) portable film since the heart is anterior and will appear magnified. \nNote also that in acute-onset LVF you may not get cardiac enlargement.\n71\n4\nLeft ventricular failure (LVF)\nA\nFigure 4.30  (A) Patient presented with an acute \ncardiac event. This patient’s scan clearly shows \n‘bat’s wing’ hilar shadows characteristic of \npulmonary oedema. At present the pleural spaces \nare clear but it is common in pulmonary oedema to \ndevelop pleural effusions. These are often larger on \nthe right than on the left. Pulmonary upper zone \nblood vessels are also often dilated (arrows). \n2.	 Look for Kerley B lines. These are caused by oedema of the interlobular \nsepta. They are horizontal, nonbranching, white lines best seen at the \nperiphery of the lung just above the costophrenic angle.\n3.	 Compare the size of the upper lobe and lower lobe blood vessels. Take \nan upper lobe and a lower lobe blood vessel at similar distances from the \nhilum and compare their widths. The upper should be narrower than the \nlower. If they are the same size or the upper is wider there is upper lobe \nblood diversion – the first sign of heart failure. Note that this only \napplies to an erect film. Upper lobe blood diversion is normal on a \nsupine film and not suggestive of heart failure – a common mistake. \nUpper lobe blood diversion is due to lower zone arteriolar \nvasoconstriction secondary to alveolar hypoxia.\n4.	 Look for whiteness that spreads out from the hilum giving a ‘bat’s wing’ \nappearance. This is what you see in severe heart failure. To confirm \nsevere heart failure as the cause of this more generalised whiteness look \nThe white lung field\n72\nB\n(B) The magnified image of the right lower zone shows the horizontal septal \nlines more clearly (arrow). \nFigure 4.30\nagain for upper lobe blood diversion and Kerley B lines. Look also at the \nhilum. In pulmonary oedema it may appear distended and the vessels \nclose to the hilum may be blurred.\nLVF and CT\nTo diagnose pulmonary oedema secondary to LVF on a CT you need to look \nfor the same features such as a large heart and evidence of interstitial oedema \nthat you looked for in the plain CXR (Fig. 4.31). Therefore:\nThe white lung field\n74\nACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)\nARDS is defined as respiratory failure in association with a CXR that shows \nconfluent alveolar opacification (whitening) of the lungs that looks like \npulmonary oedema.\nThe other (and far more common) cause of pulmonary oedema is LVF, \nwhich is also a cause of respiratory failure. Therefore, if you see a CXR that \nhas bilateral white shadows in the lungs and you suspect ARDS look for the \nfollowing clues:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing (Fig. 4.32). In ARDS it should \nbe present in both lungs – that is part of the definition. Look also at \nthe nature of the shadowing. It is usually fairly ill-defined, which means \nit is difficult to see a clear edge. It may also have the features of \nconsolidation, which means that you may be able to see an air \nbronchogram within it.\n2.	 To distinguish ARDS from LVF:\na.	 Look at the heart size. In LVF you would expect the heart to be big. \nIn ARDS it may be normal size.\nb.	 Look again at the distribution of the shadowing. In LVF it \ntends to be more central whereas in ARDS it is more \nperipheral.\nc.	 Look for Kerley B lines. Although these do occur in ARDS they are \nfar more common in LVF.\nd.	 Look for the presence of a pleural effusion. These may be small so \nlook carefully at the edge of the diaphragm for loss of the normal \ncostophrenic angle. Pleural effusions can occur in ARDS but they are \nmuch more common in LVF.\ne.	 Look at old films. A large heart and pleural effusion may have shown \non earlier films and may point to left ventricular failure as a more \nlikely diagnosis.\nIf you are certain that the CXR suggests a diagnosis of ARDS then look \nfor clues as to the cause. There are many causes of ARDS (see Box 4.6) \nand most can only be picked up by history and examination. However, \nan asymmetrical distribution of the shadowing, i.e. significantly more shad­\nowing in one lung than the other, may point to lung injury as a cause. \nCXRs taken just before the development of ARDS may show an obvious \npneumonia. (See Box 4.7 for complications of ARDS.)\nARDS and CT\nA CT scan can confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and also give useful informa­\ntion about the aetiology and prognosis (Fig. 4.33).\n75\n4\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nFigure 4.32  This 36-year-old man presented with severe \nupper abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having \npancreatitis. Whilst in hospital he became acutely short of \nbreath and required intubation and ventilation. Note the \nET tube (arrow). A CXR was taken which suggested that \nhe had developed the complication of acute respiratory \ndistress syndrome (ARDS). Note that the x-ray shows \nmultiple bilateral white shadows but does not have any \nsigns of left ventricular failure. Unfortunately this man \ndied after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation on the \nintensive care unit. \nWhen looking at the CT:\n1.	 Check that the white abnormalities are present in both lungs. ARDS is \nalways bilateral.\n2.	 Look at the nature of the abnormalities. The commonest abnormalities \nare ground glass shadowing and consolidation.\n3.	 Look for interstitial thickening. This will appear as linear opacities.\n4.	 Check the distribution of the shadows. This can give a clue to the \naetiology. A general rule is that an asymmetrical distribution of shadows is \nmore likely to be due to pulmonary disease and a symmetrical distribution \ndue to extra-pulmonary disease. Diffuse shadowing is associated with a \nworse prognosis than shadowing confined to the lower zones.\nBronchiectasis\n77\n4\nBRONCHIECTASIS\nBronchiectasis can be difficult to diagnose on a plain CXR (Fig. 4.34). If you \nsuspect it as a cause of increased shadowing then look for the following \nfeatures:\n1.	 Ring shadows. These look like rings and are any size up to 1 cm in diameter. \nThey can be single but usually occur in groups giving a ‘bunches of grapes’ \nappearance. Ring shadows represent diseased bronchi seen end on.\n2.	 Tramline shadows. Look for these towards the periphery of the lung. \nThey consist of two thick white parallel lines separated by black. It is \ncommon to get parallel lines close to the hilum in the normal CXR but \nthese lines are hairline in nature. True tramline shadowing is thicker and \nis not necessarily close to the hilum. Tramline shadows are diseased \nbronchi seen side on.\nFigure 4.34  A localised area of bronchiectasis in the \nright lower lobe which has resulted from an earlier \npertussis infection. In the lower lobe you can see a \ncluster of typical ring shadows giving a ‘bunches of \ngrapes’ appearance (1) together with bronchial wall \nthickening seen side-on, which gives two thick \nparallel lines, known as tramline shadows (2). \n2\n1\nThe white lung field\n78\n3.	 Tubular shadows. These are solid thick white shadows up to 8 mm wide. \nThey represent bronchi filled with secretions seen side on. They are not \ncommon but their presence suggests bronchiectasis.\n4.	 Glove finger shadows. These represent a group of tubular shadows seen \nhead on and look like the fingers of a glove – hence the name!\nThe presence of any of these features suggests the possibility of bronchiecta­\nsis. A normal CXR does not, however, exclude the diagnosis and CT scanning \nis the most sensitive diagnostic test available.\nThe HRCT scan and bronchiectasis\nAlthough bronchiectasis can be diagnosed on a plain CXR, in half the patients \nthe x-ray is normal. Therefore, if you suspect bronchiectasis and the CXR is \nnormal, you will need to undertake a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan (Fig. \n4.35). An HRCT scan may also give you clues as to the cause of the bronchiecta­\nsis and will give you a much more accurate picture of the extent of disease.\nTo diagnose bronchiectasis on HRCT scanning you need to identify areas \nin which the bronchi are dilated. There are a number of ways of doing this. \nLook at the lung windows:\n1.	 Look in the periphery of the lung, where the airways are round. Compare \nthe airway diameter here to that of the neighbouring blood vessels. If the \ndiameter of the airway is larger than that of the neighbouring blood \nvessel, then it is dilated. The airway is usually patent so will have a black \nhole in the middle whereas the blood vessel is solid white.\n2.	 Look in the middle third of the lung fields. The airways here can be seen \nalong their long axis, and the airway walls should normally taper over 2 cm. \nIf there is no tapering, this is a sign of more proximal airway dilatation.\n3.	 Look for areas of mucus plugging. These are airways in which the lumen \nhas been blocked by mucus. The normal airway has the appearance of a \nwhite ring (the airway wall) surrounding a black hole (the air within the \nairway). When the airway is plugged it has a solid appearance – the \nplug, being mucus, may have a lower density (be darker) than the airway \nwall when you look at the mediastinal windows. Occasionally it is not \nclear whether these structures are impacted airways or blood vessels \nsince both may appear white.\n4.	 Look at the lung parenchyma around the airways, since changes in the \nlung occur around bronchiectatic airways. These changes include:\n•	 areas of collapse, known as atelectasis\n•	 areas of very small airway plugging, known as ‘tree in bud’\n•	 larger patches of consolidation.\nThe HRCT scan may also give some clues as to the cause of the bron­\nchiectasis (Box 4.8). The radiologist will look at the distribution of the changes \nto give an indication of the possible aetiology. For example:\n•	 If it is localised to one lobe or one segment of lung it could be due to an \nobstructive lesion which would require further investigation by a \ncontiguous CT scan and a bronchoscopy to find the cause.\nThe white lung field\n80\nFIBROSIS\nFibrosis is one of the rarer causes of white lung (Box 4.9) and you need \nto differentiate it from consolidation or oedema which is far more common \n(Fig. 4.36). If you suspect fibrosis:\n1.	 Look at old x-rays if possible. Fibrosis is a fairly chronic process so if \npresent previously it is more likely to be fibrosis than consolidation or \noedema.\n2.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. This may help differentiate \nfibrosis from oedema since the latter is more likely to be bilateral, basal \nand peripheral. Therefore shadowing that is mid zone or apical is more \nlikely to be fibrosis.\n3.	 Look at the size of the lungs. Fibrosis may cause shrinkage of the lungs \nwhich will not be caused by consolidation or oedema. The presence of \nsmall lungs points strongly to fibrosis.\n4.	 Look at the shape of the mediastinum. Since fibrosis causes shrinkage of \nthe lungs it will pull the mediastinum and distort the outline.\n5.	 Look at the nature of the shadowing. Pulmonary fibrosis gives reticular-\nnodular shadowing which simply means a meshwork of lines that \ncombine to form nodules and ring shadows of about 5 mm in diameter. \nSometimes the meshwork is very fine, giving a ground-glass appearance, \nsaid to look like a thin veil over the lung. Later it gives a more coarse \nappearance and is said to look like a honeycomb. Compare this \nappearance to that of pulmonary oedema (Fig. 4.31) or consolidation \n(Fig. 4.14) and you will see that it is quite distinctive, although in fact it \nis the other features of fibrosis outlined above that are often the most \nuseful in making the diagnosis.\n6.	 Look at the heart border and diaphragm. Both of these may appear \nblurred if fibrosis is present.\n7.	 Look at the vascular markings. These become less distinct in areas of \nfibrosis. This is due to the development of numerous small areas of lung \ncollapse.\nBox 4.9  Causes of fibrosis\nIdiopathic\nExternal/occupational, e.g. extrinsic allergic alveolitis, asbestosis\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, psittacosis, aspiration pneumonia\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nSarcoid\nIatrogenic, e.g. amiodarone, busulfan, radiotherapy\nFibrosis\n81\n4\nFigure 4.36  A patient with usual interstitial pneumonia, \na fibrotic lung disease. The scan demonstrates a fine \nmeshwork pattern over the lungs which is worse in the \nperiphery of the lungs, especially at the lung bases. In \nvery severely affected areas a denser meshwork produces \na ‘honeycomb’ appearance. \nThe HRCT scan and pulmonary fibrosis\nHRCT is the established test for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. It is a more \nsensitive and specific test than a plain CXR. If there is clinical suspicion and the \npatient has a normal x-ray you should still order a HRCT. The scan will dem­\nonstrate the distribution and characteristics of fibrosis. This can give valuable \nclues as to its aetiology and is a sensitive way to follow disease progression.\nYou will be ordering the scan to give you details of any lung parenchymal \nchanges. Therefore you will need to order a HRCT scan so that you can see \nthe fine detail of the lung architecture (Fig. 4.37).\nFibrosis\n83\n4\nDetermining aetiology\nRadiologists may be able to determine the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis by \ncareful examination of the HRCT images. They will look for a number of \nclues, for example:\n1.	 The distribution of the fibrotic changes.\na.	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosis secondary to connective tissue \ndisease, and asbestosis are characterised by their patchy distribution and \nby the presence of subpleural, predominantly basal, fibrotic changes.\nb.	 Sarcoidosis causes changes predominantly in the upper and mid zones \nand around the hila.\n2.	 The appearance of the interlobular septa. In lymphangitis carcinomatosis \nthere is irregular thickening of the interlobular septa. Some nodular \ndeposits can also be seen on the pleura, but the distribution is not \nusually the same as that of sarcoidosis.\n3.	 The appearance of the pleura. In asbestos lung diseases the pulmonary \nfibrosis is often accompanied by changes to the pleura, notably pleural \nthickening and calcified pleural plaques.\n4.	 Mediastinal changes. In sarcoidosis the scan may demonstrate \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe HRCT scan can accurately determine the aetiology of interstitial lung \ndisease. However, this accuracy is highly dependent on the skill of the inter­\npreter and so it is vital that these scans are assessed by experienced radiolo­\ngists. Take care to ensure the radiologist is provided with full clinical \ninformation to aid interpretation.\nFOCUS ON GROUND GLASS SHADOWING\nGround glass shadowing is a common finding on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans \n(see Fig. 4.38). It is seen on the lung windows and is a subtle increase in whiteness \nof the lung parenchyma. To distinguish it from consolidation, look for blood \nvessels. In ground glass shadowing you will still be able to see the blood vessels \nunlike in consolidation where these are obscured. Look also at the airways. In \nconsolidation the airway wall is obscured leaving only the air within the lumen \nvisible as a black structure within the white shadowing (the air bronchogram). In \nground glass shadowing both the airway lumen and wall remain visible though \nwill be slightly less distinct than normal.\nGround glass shadowing occurs when the ratio of air to tissue changes, either \ndue to a reduction in the amount of alveolar air or an increase in a thickness of \nthe alveolar walls. A reduction in alveolar air will be caused by partial collapse of \nalveoli or small airways, and an increase in thickness of alveolar walls can be due \nto oedema or inflammation. The differential diagnosis of ground glass shadowing \nis therefore very wide and includes airways diseases, interstitial lung disease and \nvascular diseases.\nClues as to the cause can be gained by looking at the distribution of the \nshadowing. Table 4.1 shows some of the causes of ground glass shadowing and \nthe associated distribution of the changes.\nThe white lung field\n84\nTable 4.1  Causes of ground glass shadowing\nCause\nDistribution of ground \nglass shadowing on CT\nOther features\nPneumocystis carinii \npneumonia (PCP)\nPerihilar, mid zone\nSeptal thickening, lung \ncysts\nSimple eosinophilic \npneumonia\nPeripheral, mid and \nupper zones\nTends to clear \nspontaneously\nAcute eosinophilic \npneumonia\nBilateral, no predominant \nzonal distribution\nUsual interstitial \npneumonia (UIP)\nPeripheral and basal, not \na prominent feature\nCT appearance usually \ndominated by fibrosis \nand honeycombing \nNonspecific interstitial \npneumonia (NSIP)\nSubpleural and \nasymmetrical\nReticular and linear \nopacities\nCryptogenic organising \npneumonia (COP)\nNo predominant \ndistribution\nAssociated with nodules \nand consolidation\nAcute interstitial \npneumonia (AIP)\nBilateral and symmetrical, \nusually widespread \nthough more \npredominant in lower \nzones\nConsolidation and \nfibrosis in later stages\nRespiratory \nbronchiolitis-associated \ninterstitial lung disease \n(RBILD)\nUpper zone preference\nPatchy areas of fibrosis \nand bronchial wall \nthickening\nPulmonary oedema\nPosteriorly (the \ndependent area with the \npatient lying flat)\nLarge heart and \nprominent septal lines\nHypersensitivity \npneumonitis\nBilateral, mid and lower \nzones\nDrug reactions\nMore commonly \nperipheral\nOverlap with \nhypersensitivity \npneumonitis features\nVasculitis, Wegener’s\nPatchy distribution\nOften discrete nodules \nand cavitation\nIdiopathic pulmonary \nhaemorrhage\nOften upper zone, can be \npatchy\nClinical presentation \nremarkable\nThe white lung field\n86\nFigure 4.39  A woman admitted with an acute \nabdomen shows the typical appearance of old \nchickenpox pneumonia.

(A) The \ntypical miliary shadowing characteristic \nof tuberculosis (TB) is shown. \nMILIARY SHADOWING\nA number of abnormalities cause a spotted or miliary appearance of the \nlung (Fig. 4.40) but normal lung can also have a spotty or mottled \nappearance, especially in obese patients. If you think the lung looks spotty \nyou must first determine whether it is miliary shadowing or normal lung:\n1.	 Look at the distribution of the shadowing. Look carefully at the \nperiphery. If the shadowing is present in the periphery it is far more \nlikely to be pathological. Sometimes normal vasculature can mimic \ninterstitial shadowing but this usually occurs only towards the centre of \nthe lung fields.\nThe white lung field\n88\nB\n(B) There is also soft shadowing in the left apex consistent with TB. \nFigure 4.40\n2.	 Carefully examine the shadowing. With miliary shadowing the opacities \nshould be discrete. Noise from overlying soft tissue can appear more \nfuzzy.\n3.	 Compare a few of the opacities with one another. If the shadowing is \nmiliary they should be of a similar density and size.\nIf you feel the shadowing is miliary then look for clues as to its cause. \nLikely possibilities are miliary TB, sarcoid or malignant miliary metastasis:\n1.	 Look again at the distribution. With miliary TB the opacities are most \nprofuse in the upper zone, with sarcoid they are most profuse in the \nperihilar and mid zones, and with miliary metastases there may be more \nopacities in the lower zone.\n2.	 Look at the density. High density, very white shadows are likely to be \ndust-related industrial disease or calcified TB. Less dense changes could \nbe multiple secondaries, sarcoid or any of the other causes of miliary \nmottling.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray for signs of other disease processes. Look \nat the hilum. Unilateral hilar enlargement suggests TB, and bilateral \nhilar enlargement sarcoidosis. Look at the upper part of the \nmediastinum for thyroid enlargement which could suggest secondaries \nfrom a thyroid carcinoma. Look at the apices for subtle cavitating \nlesions suggestive of TB. Note, however, that the presence of apical \nshadowing, although suggestive of TB, is in fact very rare in patients \nwith miliary spread.\nMiliary shadowing\n89\n4\nFOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS\nTuberculosis can cause a large number of changes on the CXR. It is a diagnosis \nthat can often be missed and you should always think about including it in your \ndifferential diagnosis of any CXR change.\nPrimary pulmonary TB is usually a self-limiting disease which is often asymp­\ntomatic. Infection leads to the development of a primary complex in the lung \nwhich over the years will calcify, forming a granuloma. Figure 4.41 shows an \nexample of such a granuloma. On occasions the primary infection is not \nlimited and the patient goes on to develop the complications seen in reactiva­ ted \ndisease.\nIn later life, if the immune response becomes less effective due to disease, \nold age, or reinfection, the primary infection can reactivate and the patient \nwill usually develop symptoms. These may include cough, haemoptysis or \nFigure 4.41  This is the chest x-ray of a 27-year-old lady with asthma. There is an \nincidental finding of a small granuloma (1) in the right apex. This is likely to result from \nprevious tuberculosis infection, which, in this patient, as with many, was subclinical.\n1\nThe white lung field\n90\nFigure 4.43  This is the CXR of a 26-year-old lady who has been fully treated for \ntuberculosis.

It is a cause of pleural \neffusions or lung collapse. Other changes that should make you think specifically \nof TB are upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 4.42), single or multiple cavitating \nlesions (Figs 4.43 and 4.44), enlarged hilar lymph nodes (Fig. 4.45) or miliary TB \n(Fig. 4.40).\nTuberculosis can lead to chronic fibrotic changes in the lung. Typically these \nare in the upper zones, as shown in Figure 4.46.\nFigure 4.46  CXR showing chronic upper lobe fibrotic changes (1) in patient with old \npulmonary tuberculosis. \n1\n1\nThe black lung field\n94\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)\nWhen trying to decide the cause of bilateral black lungs (Fig. 5.1) you \nneed to:\n1.	 Check the penetration. Look at the vertebral bodies behind the \nheart. Remember that in a good-quality x-ray the vertebral \nbodies become harder to see behind the heart shadow. If they are \ntoo clearly seen the film is over-penetrated, making the lungs appear \nblack.\nIf you are satisfied with the technical quality of the film then the most likely \ncause is COPD. COPD is associated with large lungs due to air trapping and \nthe development of bullae. You therefore need to:\n1.	 Look at the shape of the diaphragm. In COPD the diaphragms are flat or \neven scallop shaped instead of concave upwards. This is a more reliable \nsign of hyperexpansion than rib counting.\n2.	 Count the number of ribs you see anteriorly. If the lungs are enlarged \nyou should be able to count more than seven. Be careful, however, \nbecause you can sometimes count more than seven ribs in normal \npatients if they are tall and slim.\n3.	 Look at the shape of the heart. The enlarged thorax of COPD \nappears on the x-ray to elongate and narrow the heart, elevating the \nlower border. The heart, instead of sitting on the diaphragm, often \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. It will also appear small unless there is \nalso an element of cardiac failure, in which case it will be normal in size \nor large.\n4.	 Look for bullae. These are densely black areas of lung, usually round, \nsurrounded by fine curvilinear shadows. Bullae distort the surrounding \nvasculature so to help find them look out for areas of distortion of \nvascular markings.\n5.	 Look at the distribution of lung markings. The black lungs of \nCOPD are due to reduced size of blood vessels. The lung markings \nare reduced bilaterally and fan out in straight lines from the hilum, \nstarting off chunky but stopping two-thirds of the way out – peripheral \npruning.\n95\n5\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nFigure 5.1  Chest film of a patient with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs look larger \nin volume than normal. The diaphragms are rather \nflattened. The right upper zone and many areas of \nthe left lung are abnormally black. In these areas \nthe blood vessels are difficult to see or are very \nthinned. This is because these regions of lung have \ndeveloped emphysema.  \nThe black lung field\n98\nBox 5.1  Some causes of a pneumothorax\nSpontaneous\nIatrogenic/trauma, e.g. pleural tap, transbronchial biopsy, central venous \nline insertion, mechanical ventilation\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nInfection, e.g. pneumonia, tuberculosis\nCystic fibrosis\nConnective tissue disorders, e.g. Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos\nPNEUMOTHORAX\nWhen you see a unilateral black lung (Fig. 5.5) you need to:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film may make one \nside less dense than the other.\n2.	 Determine which side is abnormal. This is usually easy since the side \nwith reduced lung markings will be the abnormal side.\nYou must now decide the cause of the blackness. Lung markings are made \nup of bronchi and blood vessels and it is their absence that makes the lung \nlook black. Vascular shadows will disappear if the lung is replaced by air, \nwhich will occur with a pneumothorax, or bullous, or cystic lung disease, or \nif the vessels are deprived of blood as in a pulmonary embolus (PE). Therefore \nthink pneumothorax, bullae/cyst or pulmonary embolism and:\n1.	 Look for a lung edge. In a pneumothorax you will see the edge of lung \nwhich is not normally seen. Look carefully at the upper zone where air \nwill accumulate first. Your eye is trained to see horizontal lines better \nthan vertical so it is sometimes easier to detect the lung edge with the \nx-ray turned on its side.\n2.	 Look at the mediastinum. Obvious mediastinal shift away from the \nblack lung suggests that a tension pneumothorax is developing. This is \na medical emergency and you need to urgently reassess the patient \n(see also p. 97).\n3.	 Look at the rest of the lungs. Bullous disease is more likely if bullae or \nemphysematous changes are seen in the rest of the lung.\n4.	 Differentiating between a pneumothorax and a bulla can be difficult \nand often impossible. Look at the distribution of the blackness. In a \npneumothorax it will be peripheral and upper zone, or lateral and even \nunderneath the lung. Bullae are within the lung and have curvilinear \nconvex margins. In a pneumothorax the edge of the blackness will run \nparallel to the chest wall, which will not be the case with a bulla lying \nwithin the lung.\n5.	 Look carefully for lung markings. If you see them crossing the area of \nblackness, you are probably looking at a bulla. If you see lung markings \nperipheral to the blackness, it is also probably a bulla.\nBox 5.1 shows possible causes of a pneumothorax.\nPneumothorax\n99\n5\nFigure 5.5  This patient has a left-sided \npneumothorax with partial collapse of the left lung. \nThe outer left lung field is black. You can see the \nlung edge (arrows). \nThe black lung field\n100\nFigure 5.6  This chest film shows the \npotentially fatal condition of a tension \npneumothorax. The build-up of pressure in \nthe thorax on the side of the air leak can \nobstruct cardiac venous return. This can be \npotentially fatal if the pleural cavity is not \nurgently drained. \nTENSION PNEUMOTHORAX\nIf you suspect a pneumothorax (Fig. 5.6) as a cause of a black lung field you \nmust consider carefully whether it may be under tension since this is a medical \nemergency.\n1.	 Look at the size of the blackness. In a tension pneumothorax the black \nlung is usually very large.\n2.	 Look at the position of the mediastinum. In a tension pneumothorax it \nwill be shifted away from the affected lung.\nThe black lung field\n102\nThink before you order a CTPA. These scans are often undertaken in young \npeople and involve significant amounts of radiation. Make sure that you have \nstratified the clinical risk by taking an appropriate history and reviewing the \nD-dimer result, and consider whether a  \nV/Q scan or ultrasound imaging of \nthe peripheral veins to look for a deep vein thrombosis would be a reasonable \nalternative.\nIn order to interpret a spiral CT scan you need to:\n1.	 Look at the contrast enhanced scans, usually labelled as such.\n2.	 Look at the main pulmonary artery and then follow your way through \nthe scans to examine the major pulmonary vessels. With the spiral CT \nscan you will be able to visualise the clot, which will appear as a filling \ndefect – a dark area surrounded by whiter contrast. Clot tends to lodge \nacross bifurcations in the vessels and may be seen extending down the \nvessel towards the periphery. The vessel may be expanded by acute clot \ncompared to the equivalent vessel in the other lung.\n3.	 Look for accompanying features of an embolus. Look on the lung \nwindows for areas of consolidation, which may be wedge shaped, and \nalso look for small pleural effusions.\n4.	 Remember that even if the CTPA does not show a PE it may show \nanother cause for the patient’s symptoms.\n scanning\nThe  \nV/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test. This uses small low-dose radioactive \nparticles to compare the pattern of perfusion with that of ventilation \n(Fig. 5.8). For the ventilation part of the test the particles are suspended in a \ngas, which is then inhaled, and stick to the walls of the airways to show airflow. \nFor the perfusion part of the study the particles are injected intravenously and \nlodge in the very small blood vessels in the lungs. The distribution of radioactiv­\nity within the lung is then monitored using a gamma camera. Normally four \nviews are taken (anterior, posterior, and right and left posterior oblique).\n \nV/Q\nFigure 5.8   \nV/Q scan in patient with pulmonary emboli. Note how the perfusion image is \nmore patchy than the smoother texture of the ventilation scan. \n103\n5\nPulmonary embolus (PE)\nIn the normal lung ventilation and perfusion should match. In a pulmonary \nembolism the blood supply to a region of lung is reduced but the ventilation \nmaintained, so-called ‘ventilation/perfusion mismatch’. In some lung diseases, \nfor example pneumonia, the ventilation and perfusion may both be reduced, \ngiving a so-called ‘matched defect’. Other lung diseases, for example COPD, \ncan result in a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. In practise with \na PE it is very common to see a mixture of both matched and mismatched \ndefects. A  \nV/Q scan is therefore only of value in a patient with otherwise \nnormal lungs.\nThe  \nV/Q scan does not give a definite diagnosis of PE. Instead it gives you \nthe probability of the patient having a PE. As such, it must be interpreted \nalongside the clinical situation. A normal scan will virtually exclude a PE, \ncertainly one of clinical significance.\nIn order to interpret a  \nV/Q scan:\n1.	 Look at the plain CXR. Abnormalities on the CXR may affect \nventilation and perfusion and so may make interpretation of the scan \ndifficult. A scan can be interpreted with much more confidence in the \npresence of a normal CXR. Someone with multiple areas of lung \npathology on their chest film, e.g. consolidation or extensive COPD, is \nlikely to have an inconclusive  \nV/Q scan, and may be better investigated \nby CTPA.\n2.	 Look at the perfusion scan (labelled Q). A dark speckled pattern \nis seen over the well-perfused areas, with under-perfused areas \nappearing as lighter holes. Compare these areas to the ventilation \nscan (marked V). If they also appear light then they are classified as \nmatched defects. If ventilation is normal they are classed as mismatched \ndefects.\n3.	 Make sure that you have looked at both lungs. In the presence of a \nmassive PE it is possible for a whole lung to be obliterated on the perfusion \nscan.\n4.	 The test needs to be carefully interpreted by a radiologist who will \ndetermine the number and size of matched, and mismatched, defects to \nwork out the radiological probability of a PE.\nAlthough a PE is a cause of black lung, the findings on x-ray following a PE \nare those due to subsequent infarction of the lung, leading to haemorrhage or \nlung necrosis, see Box 5.2.\nBox 5.2  Changes of infarction\nRaised hemidiaphragm\nCollapse and linear atelectasis\nPleural effusion\nWedge-shaped shadowing\nThe black lung field\n104\nMASTECTOMY\nIt is important to remember that problems outside the lung can sometimes \ncause the lung fields to look too black (or too white). This is why it is impor­\ntant always to examine the CXR for soft tissue markings (Fig. 5.9).\nA mastectomy will make the underlying lung look too black since there \nwill be less soft tissue overlying the lungs on the affected side, compared to \nthe normal side (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, if one lung looks blacker than the other, \nlook carefully for the breast shadows. There will be an absent breast shadow \non the side of the mastectomy.\nFigure 5.9  Film of a patient who has undergone a \nunilateral mastectomy on the right side. \nR\nL\nThe abnormal hilum\n106\nUNILATERAL HILAR ENLARGEMENT\nHilar enlargement is difficult (Fig. 6.1). Suspect unilateral hilar enlarge­\nment if:\n1.	 One hilum is bigger than the other (obviously – they should be the same \nsize!).\n2.	 One hilum is denser than the other.\n3.	 There is a loss of the normal concave shape – the hila are usually \nconcave in shape. This concavity may disappear and be the first sign of \nhilar enlargement.\nIf you suspect unilateral hilar enlargement (Box 6.1) then:\n1.	 Check the technical quality of the film. A rotated film will make one \nhilum appear larger than another.\nFigure 6.1  This patient has a bulky right hilum. \nThe contour of the right pulmonary artery is not \nseen separate to it. \nUnilateral hilar enlargement\n107\n6\n2.	 Look at the lateral film. An enlarged hilum may look abnormally dense \non the lateral and sometimes this is easier to spot than on the posterior-\nanterior (PA).\n3.	 Look at the old films. You will be less worried if the x-ray looked the \nsame 15 years ago!\nNow you need to decide whether the enlargement is due to (a) enlarged \nvascular shadows, (b) enlargement of the hilar lymph nodes, or (c) a central \nbronchial carcinoma superimposed over the hilar shadow. These are the likely \npossibilities.\n1.	 Look at the edge of the hilum. Vascular margins are usually smooth in \nnature. Lymphadenopathy gives a smooth lobular appearance. \nSpiculated, irregular or indistinct margins suggest malignancy.\n2.	 Look for the presence of calcium, which will appear as a very dense \nwhite. Its presence suggests lymphadenopathy.\n3.	 Look at the rest of the x-ray. If you suspect hilar enlargement then look \ncarefully at the periphery for lung lesions (tumour, tuberculosis), lung \ninfiltration (carcinomatous lymphangitis) or bone lesions (metastases).\n4.	 Look at the rest of the mediastinum. Malignant hilar enlargement may \nbe associated with superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\nHilar enlargement always warrants further investigation.\nComputed tomography (CT) and hilar enlargement\nComputed tomography is the best modality to assess hilar enlargement and \ndetermine its cause. Hilar enlargement may be due to lymph node enlargement, \nCT appearance of which is described in pages 26–28. The CT will also show \nvascular causes of hilar enlargement as described on pages 125–126.\nSometimes lesions in front or behind the hila can give the appearance \nof hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray (CXR). Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows \nsuch an example.\nBox 6.1  Causes of unilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of hilar lymphadenopathy\nNeoplastic, e.g. spread from bronchial carcinoma, primary lymphoma\nInfective, e.g. tuberculosis\nSarcoidosis (rarely unilateral)\nCauses of hilar vascular enlargement\nPulmonary artery aneurysm\nPoststenotic dilatation of the pulmonary artery\nBilateral hilar enlargement\n109\n6\nFigure 6.3  In this patient both hilar regions are \nenlarged. The pulmonary arteries leading away \nfrom the hila are normal in size. This indicates that \nthere is lymph node enlargement at both hila. This \npatient was a 30-year-old man with a skin rash, \nerythema nodosum, and his diagnosis was \nsarcoidosis. \nIf you suspect sarcoidosis then enlargement of the hilum may be the only \nfinding. However, other features are often present and you should look for:\n1.	 Small nodules. These are between 1.5 and 3 mm in diameter, are mostly \nfound in the perihilar and mid zones, are nonuniform in character, \nmoderately well-defined and usually bilateral.\n2.	 Large nodules. These are about 1 cm in diameter, have an ill-defined \nedge and sometimes coalesce to give larger opacities which may contain \nair bronchograms.\n3.	 Lines. The x-ray may demonstrate a network of fine lines emanating \nfrom the hilar region.\nThe abnormal hilum\n110\nBox 6.2  Causes of bilateral hilar enlargement\nCauses of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy\nSarcoid\nTumours, e.g. lymphoma, bronchial carcinoma, metastatic tumours\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, recurrent chest infections, AIDS\nBerylliosis\nCauses of pulmonary hypertension\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma, COPD\nLeft heart disease, e.g. mitral stenosis, left ventricular failure\nLeft to right shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect\nRecurrent pulmonary emboli\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\n4.	 Honeycombing. Features of fibrosis may be apparent. Look for these \nparticularly in the upper zones where they are especially common.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n112\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)\nAlways remember to study the heart and the pulmonary arteries. If the heart \nis enlarged or pulmonary hypertension is present then one possible cause is \nan atrial septal defect (ASD) (Fig. 7.1). If you suspect an ASD then look for \nthe following:\n1.	 The heart may be enlarged. Determine the cardiothoracic ratio \nby measuring the width of the thorax and the width of the heart. \nIf the heart is more than half the diameter of the thorax it is \nenlarged.\nFigure 7.1  This x-ray shows the typical appearance \nof an atrial septal defect. The heart is enlarged, \nthe apex is rounded, the right atrium prominent \n(1) and the pulmonary arteries are dilated (2) due \nto increased pulmonary blood flow. \n2\n2\n1\n113\n7\nMitral stenosis\n2.	 Look at the shape of the heart. Look first at the apex, which is often \nrounded due to enlargement of the right ventricle and is sometimes lifted \nclear of the diaphragm. Next look at the right heart border. Because the \nright atrium enlarges, the right heart border looks much fuller than \nnormal.\n3.	 Look at the position of the heart by comparing it to the position of the \nvertebrae. With an ASD the heart is sometimes shifted to the left and so \nthe right edge of the vertebral column is revealed.\n4.	 Look at the aortic knuckle and arch of the aorta. It is often smaller if an \nASD is present since blood is diverted to the right atrium rather than \npassing through the aorta.\n5.	 Check for the signs of pulmonary hypertension (see page 108).\n6.	 If you are suspicious, organise an echocardiogram. An ASD is difficult to \ndistinguish from other left to right shunts and an echocardiogram is the \nmost appropriate means of making a diagnosis.\nMITRAL STENOSIS\nMitral stenosis can cause changes in both the shape and size of the heart (Figs \n7.2 and 7.3). It is a cause of pulmonary oedema (Box 7.1). If you suspect \nmitral stenosis review the following:\n1.	 Look at the left heart border. Look just below the left hilum where \nthe border of the heart is made up of the left atrium (see Chapter 2, \npage 18). This area is usually concave in shape but in mitral stenosis \nthe left atrium is enlarged, causing a loss of this concavity and a \nstraightening of the left heart border. Sometimes atrial enlargement is so \ngreat that this part of the heart bulges outwards.\n2.	 Look at the right heart border. Look carefully for a double shadow, \nwhich you sometimes see in a well-penetrated film and which is due to \nleft atrial dilatation.\n3.	 Identify the trachea and follow it down until you see it split into right \nand left bronchi. This is the carina, and the angle between the bronchi \nshould be less than 90 degrees. Measure this angle. If it is more than \n90 degrees this may indicate left atrial enlargement, a feature of mitral \nstenosis. However, there is wide normal variation.\n4.	 Look in the area of the mitral valve for signs of calcification, for \nexample flecks of dense white around the valve. This would suggest \nmitral valve disease, but is a rare finding.\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n114\nFigure 7.2  This film is that of a patient who had \nrheumatic fever when younger. The cardiac contour is \nabnormal with bulging on the right giving a double right \nheart border (1), prominence of the left atrial appendage \n(2) and elevation of the left main bronchus (3), indicating \nleft atrial enlargement. The left atrial pressure is elevated, \nproducing increased pulmonary venous pressure with \nupper lobe diversion (prominence of the upper lobe \nveins) and basal septal lines of interstitial oedema. \n1\n2\n3\nBox 7.1  Causes of mitral stenosis\nCongenital\nRheumatic fever\nLeft ventricular aneurysm\n115\n7\nFigure 7.3  This film shows \nfeatures consistent with severe \nmitral stenosis. The patient is in \nthe intensive care unit and you \ncan see the endotracheal tube \n(1), right internal jugular line \n(2) and electrocardiogram \nleads (3). The heart is grossly \nenlarged and you can see the \nmetallic mitral valve (4). The \nlung fields appear whiter than \nthey should and when you \nexamine them closely, you can \nsee prominent vasculature. This \npatient is from India, where \nrheumatic fever is common. \nLike other countries where \nrheumatic fever is endemic, \npatients often present late with \nsevere cardiac complications. \n1\n2\n3\n3\n4\nLEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM\nA left ventricular aneurysm is a cause of cardiac enlargement on the chest \nx-ray (CXR) (Fig. 7.4). It can often cause generalised enlargement of the left \nventricle and be indistinguishable from left ventricular dilatation. If you \nsuspect an aneurysm then look for the following:\n1.	 A bulge in the left ventricle. Follow the left border of the heart. If a part \nbulges out then this is suggestive of an aneurysm.\n2.	 Look for calcification. If the aneurysm is long-standing then it may have \nbecome calcified and you will see a rim of calcification along the heart \nborder (see Box 7.2).\nThe abnormal heart shadow\n116\nBox 7.2  Cardiac-related calcification\nA left ventricular aneurysm is not the only cause of calcification within or \naround the heart. Calcification of the pericardium can occur as a result of \ntuberculosis, or asbestos-related pleural plaques on the mediastinal surface. \nUraemic pericarditis may also calcify. Often no cause can be found.\nFigure 7.4  This film is of a 57-year-old man with \nchest pain and shortness of breath. In addition to \nthe signs of early pulmonary oedema, the film also \nshows a left ventricular aneurysm with an outward \nand upward bulge of the left ventricular apex. \nCalcification is also apparent (arrow). \nPericardial effusion\n117\n7\nPERICARDIAL EFFUSION\nA pericardial effusion is another cause of an enlarged heart shadow (Fig. 7.5). \nThe causes of a pericardial effusion are indicated in Box 7.3. If you suspect it \nthen carry out the following checks:\n1.	 Confirm that the heart shadow is enlarged. Check that it is a posterior-\nanterior (PA) film and that the largest diameter of the heart shadow is \nmore than half the largest diameter of the thorax.\nFigure 7.5  This film shows a pericardial effusion. \nThe heart shadow is enlarged and globular in shape \nand covers both hila. \nThe abnormal heart shadow\n118\n2.	 Look carefully at the shape of the heart shadow. Enlargement due to an \neffusion is generalised, so if the enlargement appears to be due to a \nspecific chamber enlarging then the cause is unlikely to be an effusion. \nThe heart shadow is globular in shape if an effusion is present; though \ndo not be put off by a bulge that you can sometimes see on the left \nheart border.\n3.	 Look at the lung fields. If cardiac enlargement is due to left ventricular \nfailure then the vascular markings should be increased, making the lung \nfields whiter than usual. In a pericardial effusion the vascular markings \nare usually normal.\n4.	 Look at previous films. A sudden increase in heart size is suggestive of a \npericardial effusion.\n5.	 Look at the hilum. In a pericardial effusion the heart shadow may cover \nboth hila. This will not occur with other forms of cardiac shadow \nenlargement.\n6.	 Look at the white line on the edge of the right side of the trachea (the \nparatracheal density). This should be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect \nCXR. If it is wider, one cause is enlargement of the superior vena cava \n(SVC). This would be consistent with a pericardial effusion (see Fig. 7.5).\nBox 7.3  Causes of pericardial effusions\nTransudate\nCongestive cardiac failure\nExudate\nPost myocardial infarction\nInfection, e.g. tuberculosis, bacterial\nNeoplastic infiltration\nCollagen vascular, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus \n(SLE)\nIatrogenic, e.g. post cardiac surgery\nEndocrine – myxoedema\nBlood\nTrauma\nNeoplastic infiltration\nAortic dissection/penetrating peptic ulcer\nBleeding diathesis, e.g. anticoagulation, leukaemia\nThe widened mediastinum\n120\nAlways look carefully at the mediastinum (Fig. 8.1). If you think that it is \nwidened then relate this finding to the clinical history. Try to find some old \nfilms and see if the mediastinum has got larger. Be aware that a normal chest \nx-ray (CXR) does not exclude a significant aortic event, such as a dissection, \nand in the presence of clinical suspicion an urgent computed tomography (CT) \nscan may be an appropriate investigation.\nImportant causes of a widened mediastinum are thyroid enlargement, \nenlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, aortic dilatation, dilatation of \nthe oesophagus or thymic tumours (Fig. 8.2). In deciding a likely cause, go \nthrough the following process:\n1.	 Check the rotation of the film. A badly rotated film can make the \nmediastinum appear widened.\n2.	 Decide whether the enlargement is at the top, middle or bottom of \nthe mediastinum. If at the top it is likely to be thyroid, thymus or \ninnominate artery. If in the middle or bottom of the mediastinum it \ncould be lymphadenopathy, aortic widening, dilatation of the \noesophagus, or a hiatal hernia.\nFigure 8.1  This is the CXR of a 58-year-old lady with \na known diagnosis of lymphoma. The x-ray shows \nwidening of the middle part of the mediastinum. If \nyou look at the right side of the trachea, above the \nright hilum you can see an increased white area \nwhich is larger than 2 mm in thickness (1). This is \ndue to enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes. \n1\n121\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\n3.	 If the shadowing is at the top then look at the position of the trachea. \nAn enlarged thyroid will displace or narrow the trachea. This will not \nhappen with a tortuous innominate artery – a common finding in the \nelderly.\n4.	 Look at the right side of the trachea. The white edge of the trachea \nshould be less than 2–3 mm wide on an erect film. An increase in its \nwidth suggests either an enlarged superior vena cava (SVC) or a \nparatracheal mass. This rule does not apply to supine films.\n5.	 If you suspect an enlarged thyroid then look at the outline of the \nshadow. A thyroid has a well-defined outline that tends to become less \nclear as one moves up the neck.\n6.	 If you suspect widening of the aorta then try and follow its outline, \nremembering that the root of the aorta is not visible. You may be able to \nFigure 8.2  A CXR of thyromegaly with tracheal deviation. This patient had shortness of \nbreath. As well as showing widespread pulmonary fibrosis, this image also demonstrates \nfeatures of thyroid enlargement. The thyroid enlargement is seen as an abnormal white \narea at the top and left of the mediastinum (1). Notice how this enlarged thyroid is \ncausing tracheal deviation to the right (2). \n2\n1\nThe widened mediastinum\n122\ndetect a continuous edge which widens to form the edge of the enlarged \nmediastinum. This would suggest that the widening is due to dilatation \nof the aorta.\n7.	 The commonest cause of an abnormal widening of the mediastinum in \nthe elderly will be unfolding of the aorta. You may be able to trace the \nmargin of the ascending aorta around the arch and to the descending \naorta. Some calcification in the wall of the aortic knuckle is a common \nfeature. If the line of calcium is separated from the edge of the aortic \nshadow this strongly suggests a dissection.\n8.	 A widened, aneurysmal, aorta can sometimes be difficult to distinguish \nfrom the more common unfolded aorta. If you can follow both edges of \nthe aorta and detect a widening this suggests an aneurysm (Fig. 8.3). CT \nis often used to assess aortic dimensions.\nFigure 8.3  A CXR of a patient with a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm. The \nmediastinum is widened to the left of the midline throughout its length, with increased \nconvexity around the aortic arch. \n123\n8\nThe widened mediastinum\nFigure 8.4  CT showing left thyroid mass. This is the CT of a patient with an enlarged \nthyroid. Notice the enlarged thyroid which appears grey in appearance (1) with tracheal \ndisplacement to the right (2). \n2\n1\nCT and the widened mediastinum\nCT is the best modality to assess the causes of mediastinal widening.\nEven if the chest x-ray is normal, you can only exclude mediastinal pathol­\nogy by performing a CT scan.\nBecause the mediastinal widening could be due to soft tissue or blood \nvessels, it is important that the scan is done with intravenous contrast. This \nwill both distinguish soft tissue from blood vessels and also enable you to \nproperly assess any vascular abnormality.\nAs with the chest x-ray, you need to methodically look at the top, middle \nand bottom of the mediastinum.\n1.	 Look at the top of the mediastinum.\nCauses of mediastinal enlargement would include the thyroid and the \nthymus (Fig. 8.4).\nThe thyroid should normally be dense due to its high iodine content and \nnot cause any tracheal displacement.\nAn enlarged thyroid may appear less dense since the enlargement is due to \nnonfunctioning tissue.\nAn enlarged thyroid would also push the trachea to the right or the left.\nLook for an enlarged thymus, which may appear as a well-defined soft \ntissue structure, which, if you follow slices downwards, may be seen to extend \nto the left in front of the heart.\n2.	 Look at the middle of the mediastinum at the slices that cover the arch \nand the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.\nThe aorta should be of uniform diameter with the ascending and descend­\ning aorta having roughly the same diameter.\nEnlargement of one of these indicates aortic aneurysm (Fig. 8.5).\nAbnormal ribs\n126\nRIB FRACTURES\nYour examination of the chest x-ray (CXR) is not completed until you have \nlooked carefully at the ribs. They should be of a uniform density with \nsmoothish, unbroken edges. The main abnormalities to look for are old and \nnew fractures and metastases.\n1.	 New fractures. Look along the edges of each rib. A new fracture will be \nseen as a break in the edge (Fig. 9.1). Once you have spotted a fracture \nlook for more information. Look at the position of the fracture. A \nfracture of any of the first three ribs is unusual and implies tremendous \nforce. Look for other fractures. A line of fractures suggests a traumatic \ninjury whereas fractures scattered throughout the ribs may suggest \nrepeated injury (as in an alcoholic) or underlying bony weakness (as in \nmalignant disease). Look at the density of the ribs and compare them in \nyour mind to other x-rays you have seen. If the ribs are less white than \nusual, this suggests underlying decrease in bone density. Finally look for \nthe complications of rib fractures – surgical emphysema, pneumothorax \nand haemothorax. Remember also that damage to the lower three ribs \nmay result in hepatic, splenic or renal injury.\n2.	 Old fractures. Again look along the edges. The callus formation that \nfollows a fracture will cause the rib to expand at this point. You need to \nlook carefully – sometimes callus formation can simulate a lung mass.\nIf you suspect a rib fracture clinically but cannot see it on the CXR do \nnot worry. Rib fractures can be missed easily on the x-ray and often cannot \nbe seen at all. The CXR is usually performed to look for potential \ncomplications.\nRib fractures\n127\n9\nFigure 9.1  Note how there is increased \nwhiteness over the left side of the chest. \nOn close inspection you can see that \nthe posterior ribs have a step in their \nalignment – these are fractures affecting \nthe 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. \nAbnormal ribs\n128\nMETASTATIC DEPOSITS\nMetastatic lesions in the ribs will tend to look like dark holes (Fig. 9.2). Scan \nthe ribs carefully for evidence of metastasis. Secondaries start in the medulla \nand spread outwards with very little reaction around them so you are literally \njust looking for a dark hole. Sometimes the underlying lung markings create \nthe impression of a metastasis in the overlying rib. If you spot a dark hole in \nthe rib, then look carefully at its edge. Compare the outline to the underlying \nlung markings. If they overlap, then the metastasis may be deceptive. If you \nsee bone metastases, check carefully to see whether there is an associated \nfracture.\nLook carefully at the other bones, which may contain similar pathology.\nFigure 9.2  Look carefully at this film. The lungs \nare over-expanded. Note the destruction of the \nposterior part of the cortex and the medulla of the \nright 5th rib with an associated ill-defined soft tissue \nmass (arrow). This is a lytic metastasis. \nAbnormal soft tissues\n130\nSURGICAL EMPHYSEMA\nAt first sight surgical emphysema gives a very messy appearance which is \nsometimes confined to the obvious soft tissue areas but may spread over the \nwhole x-ray (Fig. 10.1). If you suspect surgical emphysema, the causes of \nwhich are shown in Box 10.1, then look for the following characteristics:\n1.	 In mild cases look for lozenge-shaped areas of blackness (Fig. 10.1) \nwhich represent pockets of air in the soft tissue. These areas will all lie in \nthe same plane, which will follow the plane of the soft tissue structures.\nFigure 10.1  This is the film of a young asthmatic patient \nwho presented with chest pain. The film was taken to \nlook for complications of asthma such as a pneumothorax \nor air in the mediastinum – pneumomediastinum. Neither \ncan be seen, but there is extensive air in the soft tissues \n(arrows) over her shoulders and along the right chest \nwall, best seen in the axillary area. There probably is a \nsmall pneumothorax, but this cannot be seen on the film. \nSurgical emphysema\n131\n10\n2.	 In severe cases the orientation of the planes is lost. Instead look for \nalternating dark and white lines which appear not to be confined to \nsingle structures and cross part or all of the film.\nBox 10.1  Causes of surgical emphysema\nTrauma\nIatrogenic, e.g. surgery, chest drain insertion\nObstructive lung disease, e.g. asthma\nOesophageal injury\nGas gangrene\nThe sick patient\n134\nLINES, TUBES AND DEVICES\nChest x-rays (CXR) are commonly used to check the position of lines, \nsuch as nasogastric tubes, central venous lines and chest drains (Figs 11.2–\n11.5). When checking the x-ray you need to look at (a) whether the line \nis in the correct position, (b) whether the line is smooth or kinked, and \n(c) whether any complications have occurred when the line was inserted. \nAfter checking the x-ray it is important to document your findings in the \npatient’s notes and make a clear statement as to whether the line is safe \nto use.\nTo ensure that lines are positioned properly you need to understand \nthe relevant anatomy. Figure 11.1 shows the position of the oesophagus and \nthe subclavian and internal jugular veins. Remember these, since they will \nhelp you determine whether lines have been accurately placed.\nFinally, although the x-ray may have been ordered to check the position of \nthe line it may still yield other information. Check the lung fields, soft tissue \nstructures and bones in the same way as you would approach any CXR.\nNasogastric tubes\nYou may need to look hard at the CXR to see the nasogastric tube clearly. If \nyou are using a picture archiving (digital) system, change the contrast – this \nmay make the tube easier to see.\nOnce you have identified a section of the line, follow the line up and down. \nMake sure you can confidently see the whole line. Follow the tube down to \nFigure 11.1  This line diagram shows the course of the main veins used for central lines. \nThese all drain into the superior vena cava (SVC). The position of the oesophagus (OE) \nand stomach is also shown. LIJV, left internal jugular vein; LSV, left subclavian vein; \nRA, right atrium; RIJV, right internal jugular vein; RSV, right subclavian vein. \nRSV\nRIJV\nLIJV\nLSV\nRA\nSVC\nOE\nStomach\nLines, tubes and devices\n135\n11\nits lowest point. This should be beneath the diaphragm. Trace the line back \nup. It should follow the path of the oesophagus and so pass up centrally \nthrough the chest. A significant deviation to the left or the right may indicate \nthe line is within a bronchus rather than the oesophagus.\nCheck that the line is not kinked.\nA pneumothorax is unlikely to occur with the insertion of a nasogastric \ntube. However, it is a potential complication if the tube has entered an airway. \nIf the tube appears to be in the lung, look for a possible pneumothorax.\nCentral lines\nCheck that the line follows the anatomical boundaries shown in \nFigure 11.1.\nFigure 11.2  A CXR of a 70-year-old man who had a protracted hospital stay following an \nepisode of sepsis. A nasogastric tube has been inserted (1). You can follow the tube from \nthe top of the x-ray to its tip, which is below the diaphragm. The tube is smooth and not \nkinked and should function well. \n1\nThe sick patient\n136\nCheck the positioning of the end of the line. It should point towards the \nheart. Sometimes lines can turn back on themselves and occasionally enter \nother veins, turning away from the heart. It is not uncommon for example for \na subclavian line to turn upwards into the brachiocephalic vein and point \ntowards the head or shoulder. Check that the line is away from the cardiac \nshadow.\nCheck the line is smooth and not kinked.\nReview the lung fields carefully and check that the patient has not sustained \na pneumothorax. This is common complication of central line insertion.\nFigure 11.3  A CXR of a 61-year-old lady admitted to intensive care unit with severe \nsepsis. You can see the right-sided central line which has been introduced into the right \ninternal jugular vein (1) and follows the course of the right brachiocephalic vein. The tip \nof the line is seen in the superior vena cava (2). You can see the patient has not sustained \nthe complication of a pneumothorax. \n1\n2\nLines, tubes and devices\n137\n11\nChest drains\nCheck that the line enters the pleural cavity. Check that it is above the dia­\nphragm and has passed through the subcutaneous tissues.\nCheck that the tip of the line is not resting on the chest wall or heart border.\nCheck the line is not kinked.\nFollowing the insertion of a chest drain you may see surgical emphysema \non the x-ray. This is not uncommon.\nPacemakers\nThe position of a pacemaker needs to be checked by a cardiologist; however, \nit is useful to know the x-ray appearance of pacemakers and implantable \ndefibrillators. In Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 shows a typical dual chamber pace­\nmaker with leads going into the right atrium and right ventricle.\nFigure 11.4  In this x-ray the central line has been introduced through the right \nsubclavian vein (1) and follows the course of the subclavian through to the right \nbrachiocephalic vein. The tip can be seen in the superior vena cava (2). \n1\n2\nThe sick patient\n138\nTHE PATIENT ON INTENSIVE CARE\nThe CXR of a sick patient is often more difficult to interpret since the x-ray \nis not taken in ideal conditions (Fig. 11.6).\nThe patient is likely to be semi-erect or supine since they will not be well \nenough to stand up. This will have a particular significant effect on the distribu­\ntion of fluid. On an erect film, fluid will sink to the bottom of the lungs, obscur­\ning the diaphragm and giving a well-defined upper border, usually with a \nmeniscus. This will not be the case with a supine film where, instead, the fluid \nwill appear less distinct with no clear upper border. A pleural effusion in a supine \npatient will give a general increase in whiteness across the lung fields.\nThe film is likely to be anterior-posterior (AP) rather than posterior-anterior \n(PA). It is therefore difficult to judge the size of the heart, which will appear \nlarger than normal.\nFigure 11.5  A CXR of a 30-year-old woman with a primary pneumothorax. Note the \nright-sided chest drain. You can see the tip of the chest drain is within the pleural space \n(1) and although the line is curved, it is not kinked. Note the small amount of surgical \nemphysema at the insertion point (2). \n1\n2\nThe patient on intensive care\n139\n11\nThe patient may not have taken a deep breath and may have been unable \nto hold their breath. Not taking a deep breath will make the heart and medi­\nastinum appear wider than normal and may make the lung fields appear \nwhiter. If the patient has been unable to hold their breath the image may be \nblurred and subtle abnormalities may be missed.\nThe patient may have a number of lines and tubes. Remember that these \nlines are both inside and outside the patient. For example, an endotracheal \ntube will appear on the x-ray within the trachea but the line connecting it to \nthe ventilator may pass over the patient’s chest and so also appear on the film. \nThis is important because these lines could obscure abnormalities. In addition \nsometimes seemingly abnormal areas on an x-ray are artefacts caused by the \npresence of lines.\nRemember to look at the rest of x-ray for complications and underlying \npathology. In this case (Fig. 11.6) you can see diffuse consolidation throughout \nthe lung fields in keeping with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nFigure 11.6  This is the CXR of a 60-year-old lady on the ICU with severe ARDS. It is a \ndifficult x-ray to interpret because of the technical limitations of performing an x-ray on \nthe ICU. The x-ray is an AP projection and semi-erect. There are multiple lines crossing the \nimage. You need to look carefully at each of these. Notice the three external ECG leads \n(1,2,3). You can see the right subclavian line which appears to be in the correct position \n(4). There is an endotracheal tube (5) that stops above the carina. There is also a \nnasogastric tube (6) which on the x-ray appears to the left of the endotracheal tube and \ncourses down the oesophagus to below the diaphragm (7). \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nThe hidden abnormality\n142\nPANCOAST’S TUMOUR\nA number of abnormalities can be easily missed (Fig. 12.1). Before deciding \nan x-ray is normal:\n1.	 Look carefully at the apices of both lungs. This is a common site for \nlung pathology, for example a Pancoast’s tumour or chronic fibrosis. \nLesions here can be easily missed because the apex of the lung is hidden \nby ribs and clavicles.\n2.	 Look carefully at the heart shadow. Lesions behind the heart are often \nmissed because they are obscured by the whiteness of the heart. Look \nFigure 12.1  At first glance it may be hard to spot that \nthere is an abnormality on this film. Note, however, the \nincreased whiteness at the right apex. On the magnified \nimage you should also be able to see that the right \nsecond rib has fractured – a pathological fracture. This \nappearance is of a Pancoast’s tumour with invasion into \nthe chest wall. \nHiatus hernia\n143\n12\ncarefully for any parts of the heart shadow that look whiter than the \nrest. Look also for the triangular shadow of the left lower lobe collapse \nand other subtle changes such as consolidation behind the heart.\n3.	 Look carefully at the mediastinum. Changes in the shape of the \nmediastinum can be very subtle.\n4.	 Look at the hilum. Changes in the shape or density of the hilum can be \neasily missed.\n5.	 Obtain a lateral film – some abnormalities are more obvious on the \nlateral.\n6.	 Read the radiologist’s report!\nSpotting the abnormality in an apparently normal chest x-ray (CXR) is a \ncommon question in postgraduate exams. If confronted with such an x-ray, \nthen consider the information given in Box 12.1.\nHIATUS HERNIA\nWhen scanning an apparently normal x-ray it is important to look behind the \nheart (Fig. 12.2). The heart is usually a fairly uniform white colour and areas \nof increased whiteness can indicate possible pathology. Therefore if you see \nan area of increased whiteness behind the heart look for the following:\n1.	 Decide whether it has any of the characteristics of the white lung field \ndescribed previously. For example, can you see an air bronchogram \nwhich would suggest consolidation or the tramline or ring-like shadows \nwhich would suggest bronchiectasis?\n2.	 Look carefully at the shadowing to see whether it has the appearance \nof left lower lobe collapse. This is described on page 43 and has the \nappearance of a dense white triangle behind the heart. It is easy to miss \nso you should look carefully for this.\n3.	 Look to see whether the appearance is consistent with a hiatus hernia. \nLook for the outline of the stomach, which may appear as a rounded \nwhite line either behind the heart or next to the left heart border. Look \nfor the flat line of a fluid level that you occasionally see and is caused by \nfluid within the stomach.\nBox 12.1  Exams and the normal x-ray\nWhat you should be considering when reviewing an x-ray: \n•	 Apical shadowing\n•	 Left lower lobe collapse\n•	 Hiatus hernia (fluid level behind the heart)\n•	 Dextrocardia (with the x-ray shown the wrong way around)\n•	 Mastectomy\n•	 Air under the diaphragm\n•	 Small pneumothorax\nThe hidden abnormality\n144\nAIR UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM\nFinish your examination of the CXR by looking at the area under the dia­\nphragm (Fig. 12.3). The area immediately under the diaphragm will usually \nbe white since the upper part of the abdomen contains the dense structures of \nthe liver and spleen. Because of this you can usually only make out the upper \nsurface of the diaphragm. You may see a darker round area under the left \nhemidiaphragm. This is the air bubble within the stomach.\nOne of the main reasons for looking under the diaphragm is to detect the \npresence of free air. This is an important sign since it indicates intra-abdominal \nFigure 12.2  This is the film of a 67-year-old \npatient who complained of a chronic cough. \nYou can see a curved white line lying behind \nthe heart. This is a hiatus hernia. When \nquestioned, the patient complained of mild \nheartburn with no other symptoms. \nAir under the diaphragm\n145\n12\nFigure 12.3  An x-ray of a 72-year-old man who \npresented to casualty acutely unwell with abdominal \nand chest pain. Examination revealed a silent abdomen. \nNote the areas of blackness immediately under the \nhemidiaphragms (arrowed). This represents air collecting \nunder the diaphragm and confirms the clinical suspicion \nof abdominal perforation. Subsequent history-taking \nrevealed that he had a 2-year history of recurrent upper \nabdominal pain and on surgery a perforated gastric ulcer \nwas found. \nperforation. Other intra-abdominal pathologies you might see include areas \nof calcification (small areas of increased whiteness) under the right diaphragm \ncorresponding to gallstones, and dilated loops of bowel under the left \ndiaphragm.\nThe CXR is a very sensitive investigation for the detection of free \nabdominal air since it can detect as little as 10  mL. It appears as a rim \nof blackness immediately under the diaphragm and you will recognise this \nsince it may enable you to see both the upper and lower surface of the \ndiaphragm.\nThe hidden abnormality\n146\nIt is sometimes difficult to differentiate air under the diaphragm from the \nnormal stomach bubble. If in doubt then look at the following:\n1.	 Look at the thickness of the diaphragm: that is, the line between the \nblacker area below and the lungs above. If there is free air immediately \nbelow the diaphragm, then the white line between the air and the chest \nwill appear very thin since it will consist of the diaphragm only. If the air \nis in the stomach, then the white line created will consist of both \nstomach lining and diaphragm and appear thicker. In general, if the line \nis less than 5 mm, then free air is probably present.\n2.	 Look at the length of the air bubble: that is, the distance from its \nmedial to lateral aspect. If it is longer than half the length of the \nhemidiaphragm, it is likely to be free air, since air within the stomach is \nrestricted by the anatomy of the stomach.\n3.	 Look at both hemidiaphragms. If air is present below the right and left \nhemidiaphragms, it is likely to be free air in the abdomen.\n4.	 If you are still in doubt, order a decubitus film. This is taken with the \npatient lying on their left side. Free air will rise away from the \ndiaphragm and come to lie lateral to the liver in the uppermost aspect of \nthe abdomen whereas air within the stomach will remain in the same \nposition. Remember that it takes over 10 minutes for these changes to \noccur so the patient needs to be on their side for 10 minutes before the \nx-ray is taken.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n148\nSo far in this book we have chosen x-rays that clearly illustrate abnormalities. \nHowever, real life is not so simple and, whereas the abnormality may some­\ntimes be obvious, on many x-rays it is not so straightforward. On the wards \nand in out-patient clinics you will see x-rays where there is more than one \npathology and x-rays where the technical quality may make interpretation of \nthe x-ray difficult.\nHave a go at interpreting the following 10 chest x-rays. Some are simple \nbut others are more complicated. They reflect the type of x-ray you will see \nin the real clinical situation. However difficult they are, the grounding you \nhave gained by reading this book should be a good start.\nGood luck.\nQUESTIONS\nQuestion 1\nThis 58-year-old male is currently an in-patient on your ward recovering from \na stroke.

The tube does not follow the course of the \noesophagus but instead points to the patient’s right. It is in fact passing down \nthe right main bronchus and ending up in the right lower lobe.\nAt first sight the end of the tube may appear to be below the diaphragm. \nHowever, this is not the case. Remember the CXR is a two-dimensional image \nand the diaphragm is a humped structure. In this case the tube is lying above \nthe diaphragm either anteriorly or posteriorly. The hump of the diaphragm \nwill be situated either in front or behind the tube and gives the appearance of \nthe diaphragm being above the level of the tube’s tip.\nRemember when checking an NG tube to check both the course of the \ntube, ensuring that it follows the course of the oesophagus, and the position \nof the tip (which would usually be on the patient’s left, pointing towards or \nin the stomach).\nVery rarely these may be reversed in situs inversus.\nAnswer 2\nThe patient has an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD). She has hyperexpanded lung fields with flat diaphragms and \nthe lack of soft tissue shows that she is thin. The lungs are whiter at the \nbases because the apical hyperexpansion squashes the lower zones, pushing \nthe blood vessels closer together and due to overlying breast tissues. There \nare, however, no signs of consolidation, so she has infective bronchitis rather \nthan pneumonia.\n159\n13\nAnswers\n1\nAnswer 3\nThe chest x-ray shows a small left apical pneumothorax. This is difficult to \nspot but if you look carefully you will see that the lung field at the left apex \nappears darker than that on the right. This could be due to increased shadow­\ning on the right or lack of lung markings on the left. If you look very closely \nyou can just about see the lung edge on the left side (1). This confirms that \nthe left apex is darker because of lack of lung markings beyond the lung edge \nand presence of air in the pleural space.\nA small pneumothorax can be difficult to spot. If the clinical history is \nsuggestive, look carefully at the image, especially at the apices. On a digital \nsystem the lung edge can be made more obvious by inverting or adjusting the \ncontrast.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n160\n1\nAnswer 4\nThe patient is short of breath because he has a right pleural effusion. You can \nsee that right lung field is almost completely white and the trachea and carina \nhave been pushed to the left. There is no air bronchogram. Although there is \nno obvious meniscus, the combination of the dense whiteness with no air \nbronchogram, and the displacement of the trachea and carina to the left \n(pushed across by the build-up of pleural fluid), are very suggestive of a pleural \neffusion.\nCareful examination of the x-ray will reveal another abnormality. On the \nleft lung, behind the heart, you can see an area of increased whiteness (1). You \ncan see that it has a definite edge and a slightly rounded appearance, and \nappears separate to the diaphragm. This is a metastatic lung deposit.\nUnfortunately, this patient had a germ-cell carcinoma with pulmonary \nmetastases. The x-ray shows the importance of scanning the image thoroughly \nand not stopping when you find the most obvious abnormality.\n161\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 5\n1\n2\nThis CXR shows left lower lobe collapse.\nLeft lower lobe collapse can give rise to subtle changes that can easily \nbe missed. In this x-ray, notice that the left lung field appears smaller than \nnormal and you can no longer clearly see the diaphragm. Look carefully \nbehind the heart where you can see the line of a collapsed left lung (1), \nthe so-called ‘sail sign’. There is also a small left pleural effusion with a \nmeniscus (2).\nThis is an important sign to pick up since left lower lobe bronchial obstruc­\ntion can be due to tumour. In this case, a CT scan and bronchoscopy showed \nno tumour and the changes were due to infection with thick mucus occluding \nthe airway.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n162\n2\n1\nAnswer 6\nThe x-ray shows a patchy area of consolidation in the right lower zone on a \nbackground of old varicella zoster pneumonitis.\nThe x-ray is obviously abnormal, with the lung fields appearing much \nwhiter that they should. Looking closely at the lung fields, you can see \nnumerous small discrete nodules. These appear white because of calcifica­\ntion and they are all about the same size and less than 3  mm in diameter. \nThese nodules are from old varicella zoster pneumonitis. These nodules \nare an incidental finding and would not be causing the patient any \nsymptoms.\nIf you now take an overview of the lungs, you can see a subtle increase in \nshadowing the right lower zone (1). This is an area of patchy consolidation. \nA subsequent CT scan confirmed this to be an area of consolidation.\nThis patient had pneumonia and responded well to treatment.\nNotice the inhaler on the patient’s left side (2), probably situated in his \npyjama pocket. The patient was known to have asthma.\n163\n13\nAnswers\nAnswer 7\nThe most worrying abnormality is a cavitating lesion in the left apex (1).\nThe lungs are hyperexpanded and the patient is breathless because he \nhas COPD.\nInitially the most obvious abnormality is the hyperexpanded lung fields. \nYou can count up to 10 posterior ribs and the heart is long and elongated and \nappears to ‘swing in the wind’. When you scan the lung fields, look carefully \nat all zones of the lungs, comparing the left and the right. Be especially careful \nat the apex where abnormalities can be missed, often because they are hidden \nby overlying bones.\nIn this case, there is an increased area of whiteness in the left apex. When \nyou look carefully at this, there is a circular area of white surrounding a dark \nhole. This is a lung cavity. The concern would be that this is a lung cancer. \nFortunately, in this case, the cavity disappeared with antibiotics and turned \nout to be a lung abscess.\nThis x-ray shows the importance of scanning the lung fields in detail to \nlook for subtle abnormalities.\n1\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n164\nAnswer 8\nA right-sided internal jugular line has been inserted, but the tip is positioned \nin the right subclavian vein. You can see a grossly distended stomach beneath \nthe left hemidiaphragm.\nThis is a mobile supine image, typical for an x-ray on the ICU. If you look \nabove the right clavicle, you can see the right line, which initially follows the \ncourse of the right internal jugular vein. However, instead of following the \ncourse of the vein towards the heart, this turns towards the patient’s right and \nin the right subclavian vein. This should be repositioned.\nRemember to survey the whole x-ray and not stop when you find the mis­\nplaced line. Your survey should include areas outside the chest and, in this \ncase, you can see a large black area underneath the diaphragm: this is a dis­\ntended stomach.\n165\n13\nAnswers\n1\n2\nAnswer 9\nThis is a poor-quality x-ray because the patient is very unwell and you can \nsee the tubing leading to the NIV mask. Do not let this distract you, and look \ncarefully at the lung fields. Both lung fields appear black but the left lung field \nlooks blacker than the white. Careful inspection of the left lung field shows a \nsmall whiter area (1). This patient has a pneumothorax, which may have been \ncaused by or worsened by the positive pressure ventilation. The small white \narea is the compressed lung, with the lung edge visible on careful inspection \n(2). The rest of the left hemithorax is devoid of lung markings because the \nlung has been compressed by the pneumothorax.\nThe right lung field also looks blacker than normal but you cannot see a \nlung edge. This lung is black because the patient has emphysema and has \ndestruction of lung tissue with a reduction in soft tissue markings.\nThe chest x-ray quiz\n166\n1\nAnswer 10\nThis x-ray shows multiple lung metastases.\nThe patient is obviously unwell since the x-ray has been taken in the \nresuscitation room and is an anterior-posterior (AP) and semi-erect image.\nThe most obvious abnormality is white shadows in both lungs. When you \nlook at these closely, there are multiple areas of discrete shadows, rounded or \noval in appearance with distinct borders (1). The most likely explanation is \nthat these are secondaries from her previously known breast cancer. Unfortu­\nnately this was confirmed following a lung biopsy.\nThe patient’s fever turned out to be secondary to a urinary tract infection.\n",Localising,GPE,14,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,First,ORDINAL,PA,GPE,Fig,PERSON,1,CARDINAL,2.1,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,16,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,11,CARDINAL,PA,GPE,1,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,2.2,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,3,CARDINAL,4,CARDINAL,5,CARDINAL,6,CARDINAL,Aortic,NORP,Localising,GPE,18,CARDINAL,2.3,CARDINAL,Radiographs,ORG,AP,ORG,impor­,ORG,2.2A,CARDINAL,2.3A,PRODUCT,1,CARDINAL,1,CARDINAL,2,CARDINAL,Localising,GPE,20,CARDINAL,7,CARDINAL,Fig,PERSON,2.3A,CARDINAL,CT,ORG,22,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,two,CARDINAL,the
